<P>As you program with C or C++, you are bound to hit upon a heap-related
bug sooner or later. What's a heap, you ask? Well, it's the system
resource from which you remove chunks when you call <CODE>malloc()</CODE>, 
<CODE>calloc()</CODE>, <CODE>new()</CODE>, etc. Unfortunately, it is associated with a 
lot of really tough bugs. You see, in this code:
<PRE>
        main()
        {
                char *p = (char *) malloc(5);
                strcpy( p, "12345");
                puts(p);
        }
</PRE>
<P>...you probably get away clean in the debugging phase. You only allocated
5 bytes, you are writing 6 (5 for the string plus one trailing 0), but 
nothing seems to happen, right?
<P>Wrong.
<P>The extra byte you are writing moves your program into 
'undefined behavior' domain. Some operating systems/languages tolerate
such things, others don't. Even those who seem to do, eventually don't.
You see, the extra byte is written into memory not owned by the allocation.
What is stored there can be anything from debugging info to application 
code. 
<P>Then again, we don't free the memory we allocated. It seems we forgot to:
<PRE>
                free(p);
</PRE>

Notice also that the call to 'puts' makes the system read 6 bytes, since
puts is probably implemented in the C runtime library with something like
this:
<PRE>
                while(*p)
                     putchar(*p++);
</PRE>

...which means that not only your code, but also system and RTL (run-time
library) code accesses memory it shouldn't. This can make your program
behave in a non-predictable way - crash sometimes, work OK as long as
you don't run WinAmp... (you get the idea).
<P>If you want to quickly find heap-related bugs in your Win32 programming, 
you can use this library in addition to any others you have found/bought.
It is a simple little library, which I have found useful in my
programming efforts. Why do I use it instead of others (like the builtin
debugging heap of Visual C++ 6.0)? It's small (and thus, easily configurable)
and it supports C++. It also lacks any complicated interfaces, and provides
you with a quick and easy way to detect invalid READ as well as write
accesses (this last reason is probably the strongest point of the library). 
<P>HeapCheck employs a technique invented in the Unix's Electric Fence, created
by Bruce Perens. It uses the virtual memory hardware of your computer to 
place an inaccessible memory page immediately after (or before, at a 
<CODE>#define</CODE>
option) each memory  allocation.  When software reads or writes this 
inaccessible page, the hardware issues a segmentation  fault, stopping the 
program at the offending instruction. It is then trivial to find the erroneous
statement since Visual C++ will point to the code doing the invalid access. 
In a similar manner, memory that has been released is made 
inaccessible, and any code that touches it will get a segmentation fault.
<P>HeapCheck also checks for any allocations you forgot to free/delete, and
prints a report when your application exits to the Output window of Visual
C++. This report tells you also the allocation requirements of your program
(how much memory it needed in the previous run).
