            <p><em>(July 2020)</em></p>

<p>The COVID19 situation means that like so many other folks, over the last 4 months
I've been working remotely from home. I was told to take my work
laptop <em>(a Windows 10 machine)</em> with me - and use it everyday; connecting via VPN
and going through my tasks.</p>

<p>A lot of work has been done in 4 months. And I am backing it all up in the
encrypted ZFS mirror I built with my <a href="atomicpi.html" target="_blank">Atomic PI</a>.</p>

<p>The previous sentence says a lot. Allow me to elaborate:</p>

<div style="clear:both; text-align:center; margin: 0em 0em 0em 0em">
<img src="front-on-hi.jpg" alt="My backup (and Vagrant, and Docker, and many other things...) server"><p>
<em>My 35$ backup (and Vagrant, and Docker, and many other things...) server</em>
</div>

<h1>ZFS</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>I have attached two external 2TB USB drives on this tiny 35$ Linux server.</p></li>
<li><p>I used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS" target="_blank">ZFS</a>, the 
undisputed king of filesystems, <strong>to arrange the drives in a "mirror" configuration</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>You can think of it like so: <em>"if while my master reads his files I detect an error, I will get
that data from the other drive - and I will re-write the data in the "bad" drive
where I detected the error"</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ZFS can detect errors, because it uses checksums while reading;</strong> and when it
detects errors, it will transparently address them by reading from the spare
storage. <strong>It will also update (rewrite) the storage where the error was detected</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>ZFS would do this even if I had a single USB drive attached, if when creating the
filesystem I used the <code>"copies=2"</code> option ; basically making sure that each data block is kept in
two places on the disk. That wouldn't shield me from the whole disk going
dead, though ; hence why I use two drives.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ZFS supports compression</strong>, with various algorithms. I have more than 1.9x
compression ratio on everything I store inside it - except two ZFS filesystems
where I explicitly said I don't want that <em>(yes, you can have many filesystems
inside a single ZFS pool)</em>. Why? Because the data I store there were already
compressed (videos) - why waste CPU trying to compress them?</p></li>
<li><p>The spare storage is used by ZFS to speed up reads, too. When multiple processes
read data, <strong>both drives will be used at the same time to serve them.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>To protect the sensitivity of the data, my ZFS pool is built from encrypted
LUKS devices. The mirror is not built on the raw devices of the two disks;
it is instead built on top of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Unified_Key_Setup">LUKS</a>-encrypted
devices that are backed by them.
<strong>Simply put: if someone steals the drives, he won't be able to read anything
from them.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>The encryption uses the AES instructions on the Atom CPU; <strong>I don't experience
any slowdown</strong> when reading data from the ZFS pool.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I could speak about more things; like snapshots, and optimal use of space...
But I'll just stop here.</p>

<p>Nothing beats ZFS. Nothing even comes close.</p>

<h1>A Windows laptop on ZFS</h1>

<p>My work laptop has a 1TB NVMe storage.</p>

<p>I could try to <code>rsync</code> files to the ZFS server while Windows runs; but 
that's not really optimal. For example, Windows doesn't normally allow files opened
for writing to be read by your backup program; the dreaded "sharing violation"
is still there in many cases. And permissions under Windows are sometimes
a mystery - files fail to open for weird reasons <em>(e.g. because
the antivirus daemon decided to wake up and do something with them)</em>.</p>

<p>One thought that comes to mind that covers all angles - by allowing me to recover
from a complete disk failure - is to boot from a Linux USB stick and take a disk
image <strong>of the entire drive</strong>. I can resilver a new drive with the image;
and get back to my pristine OS setup.</p>

<p>But why take a <code>dd</code> image, when you can get a compressed <a 
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SquashFS" target="_blank">SquashFS</a>
image instead?</p>

<p>Why indeed.</p>

<p>Boot from a Linux USB stick - I use
<a href="https://www.system-rescue-cd.org/" target="_blank">SystemRescue</a> -
and after mounting your ZFS storage remotely <em>(via <code>NFS</code>, <code>CIFS</code>, etc -
take your pick)</em>, you execute this inside it:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir empty-dir
mksquashfs empty-dir squash.img -p 'nvme0n1.img f 444 root root dd if=/dev/nvme0n1 bs=1M'
rmdir empty-dir
</code></pre>

<p>What this does, is create a SquashFS filesystem that contains a single file:
<code>nvme0n1.img</code>. This file's contents are obtained by the <code>dd</code> command;
basically a bit-by-bit copy of the entire NVMe drive.</p>

<p>After a few hours, I have a <code>squash.img</code> in my ZFS pool. Nicely checksummed
and mirrored in my two USB drives. Even though the original drive was 1TB,
the SquashFS image is just 400GB.</p>

<h1>Mounting the image</h1>

<p>Now, I can mount the NTFS partition inside it:</p>

<div class='codegenWrapper'>
<pre><tt><span class="normal">$ cat /tank/ESA/Laptop/mount</span><span class="symbol">.</span><span class="normal">sh </span>

<span class="comment">#!/bin/bash</span>
<span class="normal">df </span><span class="symbol">|</span><span class="normal"> grep /iso</span><span class="number">5</span><span class="normal"> </span><span class="symbol">||</span><span class="normal"> {</span>
<span class="normal">    echo </span><span class="string">"[-] Mounting SquashFS..."</span>
<span class="normal">    mount -o loop squash</span><span class="symbol">.</span><span class="normal">img /iso</span><span class="number">5</span><span class="symbol">/</span><span class="normal"> </span><span class="symbol">||</span><span class="normal"> </span><span class="keyword">exit</span><span class="normal"> </span><span class="number">1</span>
<span class="normal">}</span>
<span class="normal">df </span><span class="symbol">|</span><span class="normal"> grep /iso</span><span class="number">6</span><span class="normal"> </span><span class="symbol">||</span><span class="normal"> {</span>
<span class="normal">    echo </span><span class="string">"[-] Mounting NTFS-3G..."</span>
<span class="normal">    losetup -f /iso</span><span class="number">5</span><span class="normal">/nvme0n1</span><span class="symbol">.</span><span class="normal">img </span>
<span class="normal">    partprobe /dev/loop</span><span class="number">0</span>
<span class="normal">    mount -o ro -t ntfs-3g  /dev/loop0p3 /iso</span><span class="number">6</span><span class="normal"> </span><span class="symbol">||</span><span class="normal"> </span><span class="keyword">exit</span><span class="normal"> </span><span class="number">1</span>
<span class="normal">}</span>
</tt></pre>
</div>

<p>After this, I get a read-only mounted copy of my entire Windows drive
on <code>/iso6</code>. Nice.</p>

<h1>Mounting the "inner" images of Linux VMs</h1>

<p>The only way I can survive under Windows, is by working inside Linux
virtual machines. Which means a lot of my data exist only inside
.vmdk / .vdi files.</p>

<p>Guess what - no problem:</p>

<div class='codegenWrapper'>
<pre><tt><span class="normal">modprobe nbd</span>
<span class="normal">qemu-nbd -r -c /dev/nbd</span><span class="number">0</span><span class="normal"> /iso</span><span class="number">6</span><span class="normal">/path/to/some</span><span class="symbol">.</span><span class="normal">vdi</span>
<span class="normal">mount /dev/nbd0p3 /somewhere</span>
</tt></pre>
</div>

<p>...and when you are done:</p>

<div class='codegenWrapper'>
<pre><tt><span class="symbol">...</span>
<span class="normal">umount /somewhere</span>
<span class="normal">qemu-nbd -d /dev/nbd</span><span class="number">0</span>
</tt></pre>
</div>

<h1>Updates</h1>

<p>OK, but that's a static image - how do you update it?</p>

<p>There are many ways. The one I use is 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OverlayFS" target="_blank">OverlayFS</a>.
Basically, any time I want, I <code>rsync</code> the new state of the data to the ZFS
server, into a path that is served by both the read-only mounted folder
from the SquashFS snapshot, <em>and</em> a writable folder that stores the differences
sent by <code>rsync</code>.</p>

<p>And whenever I want, I can use the OverlayFS-mounted folder, to create
an updated SquashFS image - and recompress everything into a new snapshot.
Just to save some space.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>So, overall - we use a compressed version of the entire drive (which in my
case was 400GB instead of the full 1TB), to mount and access the entire
contents, <code>find/grep</code> do anything we want in their contents... and also
mount the virtualized storage contained inside them, and do anything we
want inside those too.</p>

<p>And we can update it - while knowing that behind it, there's rock solid
ZFS-based mirroring. And compression. And checksums.</p>

<p>I challenge you, dear reader - to point me to something that provides all
the functionality described above, and that only costs 2 external USB drives,
and a 35$ Single Board Computer.</p>

<p><em>P.S. My periodic pool scrubs have not found any issue yet. The system
is rock solid - and I use the Atomic PI for other tasks, too - including
booting up Docker containers, and even Vagrant/libvirt ones. I didn't
expect that last part to work, but ZRAM (memory compression) really helps.</em></p>
