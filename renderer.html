<a name="intro"></a>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
  One of my hobbies that has persisted over the years is my real-time 
  pure-software 3D renderer. I began writing it in the days of Hercules 
  and CGA cards... and will probably be playing with the code for as long as I live :&#x2011;)
<p>
  My priorities, ever since I started doing this, are simple: <b>try to make the code as clear and concise as possible, 
  while using good algorithms to improve the rendering speed</b>. In plain words, my primary care is the clarity 
  of the code - as well as the renderer's speed.

  <div class="scrollableContainer">
  <img hspace="20" vspace="10" alt="Refraction" src="chessRefraction.jpg"><br>
  <em>Generated in the renderer's raytracing mode, with reflections and refractions enabled.</em>
  </div>

  <p>Conciseness and clarity are mostly accomplished via C++ templates, that unify the incremental calculations for the rasterizers
  and the ray intersections for the raytracers. And as for speed, we are now firmly in the age of multi-core CPUs - so 
  software rasterizing can (finally) do per-pixel lighting and soft-shadows in real-time, while raytracing can generate 
  beautiful images in a matter of seconds.
<div class="video-container">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M2cFz6190ZM?rel=0" frame border="0" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
</div>
  The renderer allows switching between rasterizing and raytracing in real-time - so one navigates quickly with the 
  rasterizers, and requests a raytracing when the viewpoint is interesting.
  <div class="rightFloat scrollableContainer">
  <img hspace="10" vspace="10" alt="Rendered statue" src="ajax-small.gif"><br>
  <em>On a 4-core Phenom, the shadow-mapped<br>version runs at 60 frames/sec.<br>The raytraced version: 3 sec/frame ;&#x2011;)</em>
  </div>
<a name="features"></a>
  <h3>Features</h3>

  <p>This is a <em>(more or less)</em> clean implementation of the 
  basic algorithms in polygon-based 3D graphics. The code includes...
  <ul>
  <li>3D transformations (from world coordinates, to camera-space/light-space coordinates)
  <li>Point rendering (vertex-based or triangle-based)
  <li>Anti-aliased lines rendering
  <li>Gouraud shading (complete Phong equation calculated per vertex)
  <li>Phong shading (complete Phong equation calculated per pixel)
  <li>Z-Buffer hidden surface removal
  <li>Shadow mapping 
  <li>Soft shadow mapping
  <li>Raytracing, with shadows, reflections, refractions, ambient occlusion and anti-aliasing
  <li>Portable display and keyboard handling through libSDL
  </ul>
  <p>The supported 3D formats are:
  <ul>
  <li><b>.3ds</b>, i.e. the well known 3D Studio format (via lib3ds)
  <li><b>.tri</b>, a simple binary dump of vertex and triangle data
  <li><b>.ply</b> (only the ASCII kind, as saved from <a href="http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/">MeshLab</a> and <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/shadevis/">shadevis</a>)
  </ul>
  <p>Implementation wise, the code...
  <ul>
  <li>Is orchestrated via autoconf/automake, so it will
  compile and run cleanly on most platforms (tested so far on Linux/x86,
  Mac OS/X, Windows (using TDM/MinGW gcc), OpenSolaris (GCC/TBB), OpenBSD/amd64 
  and FreeBSD/amd64)
  <li>Includes a separate <tt>VisualC</tt> directory for Windows/MSVC users, 
  with all dependencies pre-packaged for easy compilation
  <li>Can be configured to use 
  <a href="http://www.openmp.org">OpenMP</a>, provided that your compiler's
  support for OpenMP is mature enough (e.g. GCC since version 4.3.2)
  <li>Can be configured to use 
  <a href="http://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org">Intel Threading Building 
  Blocks</a>, thus taking advantage of multi-core CPUs and executing faster
  <li>Uses C++ template-based metaprogramming, in order
  to move as much rendering logic as possible from run-time to compile-time.
  </ul>
  Speed-wise...<p>This is a software-only renderer, so don't expect hardware
  class (OpenGL) speeds. Then again, speed is a relative thing: the train 
  object (available inside the source package, in the "3D-Objects" folder) 
  was rendered (in soft-shadows mode) at a meager 6fps on an Athlon 
  XP, back in 2003. Around 2005, however, a Pentium4 desktop at work took 
  this up to 11 fps. As of 2007, by way of Intel's Threading Building Blocks
  (or OpenMP) the code uses both cores of a Core2Duo to run at 23fps... 
  And since it uses TBB/OpenMP, it will automatically make use of any 
  additional cores... so give the CPUs a few more years... :&#x2011;)<p>
  <em><b>Update, November 2009</b>: On a 4-core AMD Phenom at 3.2GHz, the
  train now spins at 80 frames per second... Give me more cores! :&#x2011;)</em><br>
  <em><b>Update, September 2017</b>: On a 16-core Intel Core i9 7960X... 
  <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=intel-7960x-ubuntu-linux&amp;num=5"
  target="_blank">718 frames per second!</a></em><br>
  <em><b>Update, June 2018</b>: Phoronix shows the evolution of my renderer's
  speed <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=phoronix-14-cpus&num=3"
  target="_blank">across 28 CPUs</a></em>...<br>
  <em><b>Update, November 2020</b>: 1000 frames-per-second barrier broken,
  by <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=amd-ryzen7-5800x&num=3"
  target="_blank">Ryzen 9 5950X</a></em>...
  <p>The code also runs 20-25% faster if compiled under 64-bit environments.

  <h3>Screenshots</h3>
  Skipping points rendering, lets begin with an anti-aliased rendering of a train:

  <div class="scrollableContainer">
  <img hspace="20" vspace="20" alt="Anti-aliased train" src="trainLines.png"><br>
  <em>Notice the anti-aliasing in the zoomed section</em>
  </div>

  Moving on to more interesting rendering modes: the same train looks far better
  with shadow mapping, which allows rendering self-shadowing objects in real-time,
  even when using multiple light sources (35 frames per second on a Core2Duo):
  
  <div class="scrollableContainer">
  <img hspace="20" vspace="20" alt="Shadow mapped train" src="trainTwoLights.png"><br>
  <em>Shadow mapping - self shadowing</em>
  </div>

  In many such 3D models self-shadowing is easily identifiable, especially if we
  <a href="ajax.jpg" rel="lightbox" title="Self-shadowing statue">zoom in</a>.
  This nice chessboard exhibits it, too - running with shadow-mapping at 40 fps on a Core2Duo:
 
  <div class="scrollableContainer">
  <img hspace="20" vspace="10" alt="Chessboard" src="chessBoard.jpg"><br>
<em>Gotta find time to hook this up with gnuchess! :&#x2011;)</em>
  </div>

  The renderer also includes a SAH/AABB/BVH raytracer (<em>i.e. a raytracer
  that accelerates ray intersections using a Bounded Volume Hierarchy,
  formed from Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes, created via a Surface Area 
  Heuristic</em>). The results are of course, not real-time - but 
  quality-wise, they are on a class of their own: here's how the chessboard 
  looks when raytraced with reflections and 
  shadows (<em>11 seconds to render this frame on the same machine</em>):

  <div class="scrollableContainer">
  <img hspace="20" vspace="10" alt="Raytraced chessboard" src="chessRaytraced.jpg"><br>
  </div>

  Raytracing is orders of magnitude slower than rasterizing, but it creates beautiful images... 
  I recently (Feb 2011) completed my first steps in speeding it up with CUDA (<a href="cudarenderer-BVH.html">check it out</a>).
  Notice also how zooming-in on a pawn shows reflections of reflections...

  <div class="scrollableContainer">
  <img hspace="20" vspace="10" alt="Reflections of reflections" src="reflections.jpg">
  </div>

  ...and finally, this is how refractions create a glass dragon (<em>31 seconds to render on a Core2Duo</em>):

  <div class="scrollableContainer">
  <img hspace="20" vspace="10" alt="Glass dragon" src="glassDragon.gif">
  </div>

  Which brings us to the matter of speed, again: The program allows changing the rendering mode at runtime, and
  therefore offers interactive control of the balance between rendering speed and rendering quality:

  <div class="scrollableContainer">
  <table summary="Rendering levels" width="100%">
  <tr align="center"><td><img width="184" height="360" alt="Points" src="Stage0.png"></td>

  <tr align="center">
  <td><em>Points</em></td>

  </tr></table>
  </div>

  </div>
  <a name="sm"></a>
  <h2>Shadow mapping and soft shadows</h2>
  Shadow mapping offers a good balance between rendering quality and rendering speed.
  Shadow maps are "special pictures" rendered along the normal rendering pipeline,
  but from the point of view of the light source. They provide the "light-height"
  information that tells the rasterizer when the pixel drawn is in shadow and when 
  not.  In case you were wondering, here is what a 
  <a href="shadowmap-small.png" rel="lightbox" title="Shadow map">shadow map</a> 
  looks like (67KB image).<p>

  Normally, shadow maps generate sharp, "pixelated" shadow edges, because of the
  sampling of the shadow map. To improve this, instead of sampling only one "shadow pixel", 
  the renderer can also use a weighted average of its neighbours, and thus provide
  nice looking soft-shadows in real-time:
 
  <div class="scrollableContainer">
  <img hspace="20" vspace="20" alt="Castle" src="castle.png"><br>
<em>Self-shadowing at its finest...</em>
</div>
<p>
  Fast though it is, shadow-mapping has an issue if you zoom-in: the artifacts of the shadowmap sampling become annoying... In "deep" zooms, the renderer can be switched (at runtime) to raytracing mode, to create the correct shadows:<br>&nbsp;

  <div class="scrollableContainer">
  <table summary="Shadow mapping artifacts" width="100%">
  <tr align="center"><td><img width="260" height="414" alt="Shadow-mapped" src="millenium-shadowmapped-zoomed.png"></td>
  <td><img width="260" height="414" alt="Soft-shadowMapped" src="millenium-softshadowmapped-zoomed.png"></td>
  <td><img width="260" height="414" alt="Raycasted Shadows" src="millenium-raycastedshadows-zoomed.png"></td></tr>
  <tr align="center">
  <td><em><a href="millenium-shadowmapped.png" rel="lightbox" title="Shadow map">Shadow mapped</a></em></td>
  <td><em><a href="millenium-softshadowmapped.png" rel="lightbox" title="Soft shadow mapped">Soft shadow mapped</a></em></td>
  <td><em><a href="millenium-raycastedshadows.png"  rel="lightbox" title="Raycasted shadows">Raycasted shadows</a></em></td>
  </tr></table>
  </div>
  <div class="redBox">
  The "raycasted shadows" mode that I implemented in late 2010, was offering a compromise between the speed impact of a raytracer and the rendering artifacts of a rasterizer: it gave shadows the quality of a raytracer, but maintained some of the speed of a rasterizer, since everything else except the shadows was done via screen-space-linear interpolations: projected screen space coordinates, normal vectors used in Phong lighting, Z-Buffer handling, etc. It was also <a href="cudarenderer.html">ported to CUDA</a>, and got a hefty speedup.
<p>Two weeks later, I removed this mode in favour of a full raytracer - it was slower than the rasterizer modes anyway, and a full raytracer offers far better quality. It still exists in the CUDA port, if you are interested.
</div>
  <a name="ao"></a>
  <h2>Ambient Occlusion</h2>
The renderer uses ambient occlusion to significantly improve the rendering 
quality of indirectly lit areas.
<p>
For the rasterizers, it linearly interpolates
(per-pixel) the ambient occlusion coefficient, which must be pre-calculated 
per vertex and stored in the model (see below, "Creating more 3D objects on 
your own").
<p>
For the raytracer, by uncommenting
the <tt>#define AMBIENT_OCCLUSION</tt>, you will enable a stochastic
ambient occlusion calculation for each raytraced pixel:
When a triangle is intersected by a primary ray, <tt>AMBIENT_SAMPLES</tt> 
rays will be spawned from the intersection point, and they will be used to 
calculate the ratio of ambient light at that point.
<p>The difference is very clear:
  <div class="scrollableContainer">
  <img hspace="10" vspace="10" alt="With and without ambient occlusion" 
  src="WithAndWithoutAmbientOcclusion.gif"><br>
  <em>With and without ambient occlusion</em></div>
  Here's an ambient-occlusion raytracing of Sponza (<em>with 32 ambient rays cast per pixel</em>):

  <b>Warning about hyper-threading and many cores in general</b><p>
  If your CPU uses hyper-threading and/or has *many* cores, performance as you increase threads
  may go down instead of going up. You can control the number of threads used during 
  rendering via the OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable; and you may well have to,
  to avoid your performance going down because of memory bandwidth saturation.
  <p>
  As an example from both sides of the spectrum, on an Atom 330 (2 real cores, each one
  appearing as two "virtual"), the "virtual" cores help a lot: running with four threads,
  the raytracer is 1.3x faster than running with two.
  But on an dual-CPU, Intel Xeon W5580 (total of 8 real cores, 
  appearing as 16 "virtual"), the speed increases almost linearly as we increase threads, 
  until we reach 8 - <em>and then the speed nose-dives, with the 16 thread version being 
  <b>63 times slower (!)</b></em>.
  <p>
  So make sure you check the runtime performance of the renderer by exercising direct control
  over the number of threads (via OMP_NUM_THREADS).
  </div>
  The code is under the GPL, and lives in <a href="https://github.com/ttsiodras/renderer">GitHub</a>. Here's <a href="https://github.com/ttsiodras/renderer/archive/v2.3c.tar.gz">a tarball with the latest source code</a> (last update: 2.3c, Apr 2021).
  <a href="renderer-2.x.latest-mingw32.7z">Windows binaries</a> are also available (compiled with TDM/MinGW and Pthread-W32, and compressed with <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-zip</a>).
  <p><b>For Windows/MSVC users:</b>
<p>Just open the project solution (under <tt>VisualC/</tt>) and compile for
Release mode. It is configured by default to use Intel TBB for multithreading,
since Microsoft decided to omit OpenMP support from the free version
of its compiler (the Visual C++ Express Edition). All dependencies (include files
and libraries for SDL and TBB) are pre-packaged under <tt>VisualC/</tt>, so compilation is
as easy as it can get. 
<p>When the binary is built, right-click on
"Renderer-2.x" in the Solution explorer, and select "Properties".
Click on "Configuration Properties/Debugging", and enter
<tt>..\..\3D-Objects\chessboard.tri</tt>
inside the "Command Arguments" text box. Click on OK, hit Ctrl-F5,
and you should be seeing the chessboard spinning. Use the controls
described below to fly around the object.
<p>
The default compilation options are set for maximum optimization, using
SSE2 instructions.
<p>
If you have the commercial version of the compiler (which supports
OpenMP) you can switch from TBB to OpenMP:
<table border="0" summary="Switch to OpenMP"><tr><td>
<ul>
<li>Configuration Properties - C/C++ - Language - OpenMP: Set To "Yes"
<li>Configuration Properties - Preprocessor - Definitions: Change USE_TBB to USE_OPENMP
</ul>
</td></tr></table>
...and recompile.
<p><b>For everybody else (Linux, BSDs, Mac OS/X, etc)</b>
  <p>Compilation follows the well known procedure...

  <b>bash$</b> ./configure

  The source package includes a copy of the sources for lib3ds 1.3.0, and the
  build process will automatically build lib3ds first.
  <p>
  SSE, SSE2 and SSSE3 x86 SIMD optimizations will be detected by <tt>configure</tt>,
  but if you have a non-Intel CPU, pass your own CXXFLAGS flags, e.g.
  <pre>
  <b>bash$</b> CXXFLAGS="-maltivec" ./configure
  <b>bash$</b> make</pre>
  Compiling under 64-bit environments (e.g. AMD64 or Intel EM64T) is further improving speed; 
  compiled with the same options, the code runs 25% faster under my 64-bit Debian.<br>

  <font color="red"><em>A note for Mac OS/X and FreeBSD developers:</em></font> The default 
  FreeBSD and Mac OS/X environments (XCode) include
  an old version of GCC (4.2.x). This version is known to have issues with OpenMP,
  so if you do use it, your only available option with multicore machines is
  Intel TBB (which works fine). You can, however, download the latest GCC from
  ports, if you use FreeBSD, or from 
  <a href="http://hpc.sourceforge.net">High Performance Computing</a> for Mac OS/X -
  they both offer the latest GCC series. Results are much better this way: OpenMP works fine,
  and support for the SSE-based <tt>-mrecip</tt> option boosts the speed by more than 30%.

  <p><b>Creating more 3D objects on your own</b></p>
  The rasterizer output is looking much better if the model carries pre-calculated
  ambient occlusion information per vertex. To do this:
  <ol>
  <li>Use <a href="http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/">MeshLab</a> to convert your 3D object to .PLY.
  <li>Load it up in <a href="http://ostatic.com/shadevis">shadevis</a> and hit ENTER 
  to have shadevis calculate the ambient occlusion factors per vertex. After that, 
  hit 'D' as many times as necessary to lower the diffuse light to 0%, and hit 'a' 
  to pump up the ambient to 100%. Hit 'S' to save the object.
  <li>Load the saved '..._vis.ply' with my renderer.
  </ol>
  <em><b>Update:</b> You can now use Meshlab to perform the same work, from:
  "Filters / Color creation and processing / Ambient occlusion per vertex". Then
  save your object as <tt>.ply</tt> (Stanford polygon format) and make sure you
  have only "Color" (from the "Vert" group) selected (also, uncheck "Binary encoding").</em><p>
  Enjoy!

  <em>The dark side... of coding SMP</em>
  </div>
  <b>Rant 1: Why did you do this, you crazy person?</b><p>
  Well... I've always loved coding real-time 3D graphics. Experimenting 
  with new algorithms, trying to make things run faster, look better... 
  And as a side effect, I became a better coder&nbsp;:&#x2011;)
  <p>Anyway, these sources are 
  my "reference" implementations. At some point around 2003, I decided that it 
  was time to clean up the code that I've been hacking on over the years
  and focus on code clarity - ignoring execution speed. To that end, floating 
  point is used almost everywhere (fixed-point begone!) and this being Phong 
  shading, the complete lighting equation is calculated per pixel. I basically 
  created a "clean" implementation of everything I have ever learned about 
  polygon-related graphics. The clarity of the code also paved the way for the 
  <a href="trimesh.html">OpenGL</a> and <a href="cudarenderer.html">CUDA</a> versions...</p>
  <p><b>Rant 2: Tales of Multicore</b>
  <p>This code was single threaded until late 2007. At that point, I heard
  about OpenMP, and decided to try it out. I was amazed at how easy it was
  to make the code "OpenMP-aware": I simply added a couple of pragmas in the
  for-loops that drew the triangles and the shadow buffers, and ...presto!

  <p>The only things I had to change were static variables, which had to be 
  moved to stack space. Threading code can't tolerate global/static data, 
  because race conditions immediately appeared when more than one thread 
  worked on them.

<em>Once I began using OpenMP, the<br>
renderer crashed many C++ compilers.<br>
As of 2009, they have finally adapted!</em><br>
</div>
  <p>Only two compilers truly supported OpenMP at the time: Intel's compiler 
(version 8.1) and Microsoft's CL. GCC unfortunately died with 
'internal compiler error'. I reported this to the GCC forums, found out
that I was not the only one who had noticed, and was told (by the forum
guys) to wait.

<p>While waiting for GCC to catch up, I kept researching multicore technologies.
Functional languages seem particularly adept to SMP, and I've put them
next in line in my R&amp;D agenda (Ocaml and F# in particular). Before leaving
C++ behind, though, I heard about Intel Threading Building Blocks (TBB)
and decided to put them to the test. TBB is a portable set of C++ templates 
that makes writing threading code a lot easier than legacy APIs 
(<tt>CreateThread</tt>, <tt>_beginthread</tt>, <tt>pthread_create</tt>, etc). 
TBB is also open-source, so it was easy to work with it and figure out its 
internals. Truth be told, it also required more changes in my code 
(OpenMP required almost none). Still, it is a vast improvement compared 
to conventional threading APIs.

<p>I must also confess that I have not invested a lot of effort in using these 
technologies; I only enhanced two of my main rendering loops to make them SMP 
aware. Still, this was enough to boost the speed (on a Core2Duo) by 80%! 
Judging by the gain/effort ratio, this is one of the best bargains I've ever 
found...

<p>As of now (October 2008), GCC 4.3.2 is up to speed and compiles OpenMP 
code just fine. TBB is of course running perfectly (since it is simply a C++
template library), so choose freely between any of the two, and easily 
achieve portable multithreading. 

<p>When I say portable, I mean it: these are the tests I did...
<ol>
<li>OpenMP binaries (<tt>./configure --enable-openmp --disable-tbb</tt>) for...
    <ul>
    <li>Windows (via TDM/MinGW GCC 4.3.2)
    <li>Linux (via GCC >= 4.3.2 in both 32 and 64bit)
    <li>Linux (via Intel's compiler in 32 bit)
    <li>FreeBSD 8.0 (via latest GCC version, installed through ports, in 64bit)
    <li>Mac OS/X (follow <a href="#OSX">these instructions</a> to get a GCC
    that supports important SSE optimizations (<tt>-mrecip</tt>) and
      has stable support for OpenMP - Xcode's GCC 4.2.x is too old for OpenMP).
    </ul>
<li>TBB binaries (<tt>./configure --disable-openmp --enable-tbb</tt>) for...
    <ul>
    <li>Linux (via GCC in both 32 and 64bit)
    <li>Linux (via Intel's compiler in 32 bit)
    <li>Mac OS/X (even with Xcode's old GCC 4.2.x)
    <li>FreeBSD 8.0/64bit
    <li>OpenSolaris (tested with 2008.11 / GCC 3.4.3)
    </ul>
<li>Single-threaded binaries for...
    <ul>
    <li>Poor OpenBSD4.3/64: it doesn't have real, SMP threads. Not yet, at least :&#x2011;)
      It only has user-space ones (as Linux did at some point).  
      But it does compile the code, albeit in single-threaded mode.
    </ul>
</ol>
<p>Talk about portable code!

<em>Dynamic scheduling makes sure all cores<br>are kept busy, even for low tesselations</em>
</div>
<p>If you're still in the... dark ages and use legacy APIs (<tt>CreateThread</tt>, 
<tt>_beginthread</tt>, <tt>pthread_create</tt>, etc) you are really missing out:
Under both OpenMP and Intel TBB, I increased the rendering frame rate of 
the train object by more than 40%, by simply replacing...
<pre>
#pragma omp parallel for
</pre>
with
<pre>
#pragma omp parallel for schedule(dynamic,100)
</pre>
(similar change for TBB, at code inside <tt>Scene.cc</tt>).<p>Why? Because these
modern threading APIs allow us to easily adapt to different loads per thread, by
using dynamic thread scheduling.
