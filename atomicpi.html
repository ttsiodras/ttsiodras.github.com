<h1>Atomic PI</h1>

<div class="tldr">
<b>For the TL;DR crowd:</b>
<p>
A month ago, while browsing in <a href="https://www.cnx-software.com/">CNX software</a>,
I stumbled on an article about an Intel-based Single Board Computer (SBC);
that apparently cost only 35$. For that price, the specs were beyond impressive - 
they were in the "so low, there must be something wrong" category.
<p>
But then again, it was sold from Amazon... Heck, I just had to try!
<p>
One week later, the "bare-bones" board arrived. And another two weeks later, this little
machine has really <em>pushed my limits</em>.  I've never soldered on Intel HW before;
an Intel machine somehow always created this kind of mental block in my head:
<p>
<em>"This is not a toy"!...</em>
<p>
But due to the price of the Atomic PI, the rational part of my brain could overcome the
ridiculous mental block - and I was able to achieve the (very satisfying) results shown below.
<p>
Here it is, in all its splendor, my nerdy brothers and sisters... My new little UNIX server.
</div>

<div style="clear:both; text-align:center; margin: 0em 0em 0em 0em">

<em>The New Beast (TM) - 4-core Atom, USB 3.0, and my custom power adapter</em>
</div>

<h2>Before Atomic PI</h2>

<p>I love SBCs.
<p>
I started playing with them 3 years ago, beginning with a Raspberry PI2. A year later
I "graduated" into a setup that was
<a href="thebeast.html#thebeast">a bit more advanced</a>... A 12 Euro
ARM-based board, that I assembled into an always-on file server, and
<a href="https://www.borgbackup.org/">borgbackup</a> server; with an I2C
attached LCD screen, a fan, and various other bells and whistles.</p>

<p>I was pretty sure that for my needs, the price/performance ratio of this was unbeatable.
In comparison, the Raspberry PI3 is three times as expensive, and at the same time offers substantially
less I/O-performance (<em>since in RPIs everything has to pass through a single USB root hub</em>).</p>

<p>Instead, the heart of the tiny Beast was a dirt-cheap Orange PI Zero - with 4 USB root-level hubs,
it allowed me to connect an external female USB port to a different set of pins, and thus
connect two external USB drives directly, on separate hubs. Data transfer between them 
worked at the full USB2.0 speed - approximately 37 MBytes/sec <em>(try that with a Raspberry PI
and you'll instantly see the difference...)</em></p>

<div style="clear:both; text-align:center; margin: 0em 0em 0em 0em">
<img src="The.Beast.TM.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="The Old Beast (TM)"><p>
<em>The Old Beast (TM) - 4-core ARM, PI(D)-controlled FAN, I2C 1602, level-shifter...</em>
</div>

<p>Simply put, I was able to have more than twice the speed, via a board that cost 1/3rd the price
of an RPI3!</p>

<p>SW-wise, I compiled the <a href="https://www.armbian.com/">ARMBIAN</a> image for my Beast
myself - from sources - so I was fully in control of this tiny UNIX server. Borgbackup worked
perfectly inside it over the last year - and it has already saved me a couple of times, by giving me the
ability to have dozens of mountable backup snapshots; without paying
storage-wise for anything beyond the compressed "deltas" between them. This includes huge Virtual
machine images - try backing those up with anything except Borg and you'll see what I mean;
a simple sector-worth of data inserted in the middle of a 10GB VMDK file causes most other backup SW to store
an "extra" 10GB... Borg instead only stores a compressed version of the changed sector.</p>

<h2>"No, that's impossible..."</h2>

<p>But then, a month ago, while browsing in <a href="https://www.cnx-software.com/">CNX software</a>,
I stumbled on an article about an Intel-based Single Board Computer (SBC);
<strong>that apparently cost only 35$</strong>, while being equipped with a 4 core Atom processor,
2GB of RAM, and 16GB of EMMC. And this being an Intel machine, it came with USB3.0;
and also Gigabit Ethernet; and Wi-Fi.</p>

<p>If you know anything about HW, your reaction to this is probably the same as mine was:
<p>
<em>What the... That's impossible!<br>&nbsp;<br></em>
The pieces alone cost a lot more than 35$, never mind putting all this together!
<p>
I just had to try this out... So I took a leap of faith <em>(betting that it's not some fraudulent scheme)</em>,
and ordered this from Amazon. </p>

<p>It arrived to the Netherlands in 5 days. And I immediately realized that
something weird was up - this board had no "mainstream" way to power it on.
It needed 5V/3A to be fed over an unusual female pin header - and had no 5.5x2.1mm,
5.5x2.5mm, or any kind of a USB power plug, </p>

<p>Hmm...</p>

<h2>I like challenges - let's MacGyver this.</h2>

<p>I already had an Excelway configurable-voltage power supply that could provide
the required amps at 5V; so I ordered a female 5.5x2.5mm jack that I could use to drive
the power to the Atomic PI.</p>

<p>But while waiting for this to arrive, I just <em>had</em> to see if the board worked.</p>

<p>So I took my Arduino board - which had such a jack (one that the Excelway
plug worked with) and soldered two wires on it, driving the output directly
to the Atomic PI's pin 3 (5V) and pin 6 (GND).</p>

<div class="video-container">

</div>

<div style="text-align: center">
  <em>First step: "stealing" power from an Arduino</em>
</div>

<p>It worked!</p>

<p>I booted the machine, found that it had a Debian-based distro pre-installed in the EMMC,
and enjoyed compiling and running my <a href="renderer.html">renderer</a>.
I was not disappointed - this CPU was at least
3 times faster than my Orange PI Zero; and more importantly, the huge heatsink kept it cool,
without making any noise... With the 4 cores fully busy rendering the statue, temperature
rose to about 50C. Much better than the Orange PI zero <em>(whose puny heatsink I had attached
myself)</em> that instantly rose to above 60C, downthrottled, and forced me to deal with setting up a fan
<em>(and write a PI(D) controller in SW to control it)</em>.</p>

<p>I then launched Firefox, went to Youtube and watched in full screen a 4K 60fps video.
It worked like a charm - with no hiccups of any kind. And this being an Intel GPU,
it also meant that I had nothing to worry about, in terms of maintenance...
The curse of most ARM-based SBCs in terms of video support
is that you'll either be stuck at an ancient kernel <em>(because the makers of the board only care
about Android - i.e. kernels of series 3.x)</em> - or you can compile a kernel from the mainline,
and have a barely functioning framebuffer-based, non-accelerated X11 experience.</p>

<p>What about storage?</p>

<p>Well, a simple <code>dd</code> test showed that the EMMC <em>(read sequentially)</em> was delivering data
at 170MBytes/sec. Another insane speed difference, compared to any SD card inside a Raspberry
or an Orange PI... Which mind you, you'd have to buy extra anyway - whereas the EMMC
in the Atomic PI is already there, covered in the 35$ you paid to get the board.</p>

<h2>Power measurements</h2>

<p>The adapter arrived a few days later. I quickly desoldered the wires from the Arduino,
and put my adjustable buck PSU in the loop, so I could measure power:</p>

<div style="clear:both; text-align:center; margin: 2em 0em 2em 0em">
<a href="atomic_pi_PSU.jpg" rel="lightbox" title="Idle power measurements on Atomic PI: 5V x 0.7A = 3.5W"><img src="atomic_pi_PSU.jpg" alt="Power measurements on Atomic PI"></a>
<p>
<em>Idle power measurements on Atomic PI: 5V x 0.7A = 3.5W</em>
</div>

<ul>
<li>During boot, the Atomic PI peaked up to 1A (so, 5W)</li>
<li>After that, it stabilized to about 700mA (see picture above - 3.5W).</li>
<li>Running my renderer, and occupying all 4 cores at 100%, current jumped to 1.25A (6.25W)</li>
<li>Watching a 4K 60fps video from Youtube in Firefox full screen, ate 0.95A (~5W)</li>
<li>Doing a "dd" from a LUKS-encrypted partition (so, both reading from the USB drive and decoding the data) used 34% of one of the 4 cores, and the current was at about 1A.</li>
</ul>

<p>Those were, of course, higher numbers than my two ARM-based SBCs - but not <em>insanely</em> so.
Moreover, when I installed a spartan version of Debian Stretch <em>(with nothing X related,
and a minimal amount of services that I need for my file/backup headless needs)</em>,
I found that the idle power went even lower, to 2.5W (0.5A).</p>

<h2>Old-school: the serial port</h2>

<p>Even though it's nice to have accelerated X11 and video decoding, the purpose
I had in mind for my Atomic PI was replacing my file/backup server with it... i.e with
a headless, much more powerful machine. This would allow me to do things
like offline ffmpeg-based video transcoding, while taking advantage of the huge 
optimizations done over the years in these tools (for Intel-based CPUs).</p>

<p>That meant no monitor attached to the HDMI port. And even though I could just use
the machine over SSH with a static IP address, I still prefer to have
a fallback of a serial port - just as I did for my ARM SBCs.</p>

<p>As it turned out, that also worked fine! Connector CN10 of the board has the
required 3 pins: TX, RX and GND. Connected to a PL2303HX USB/TTL,
I could see my machine boot up over minicom...</p>

<div class="video-container">

</div>

<div style="text-align: center">
  <em>Monitoring a boot over a serial port</em>
</div>

<p>...and in fact, I could enter the BIOS and change settings over it!</p>

<p>That was a surprise... I never expected to be able to do this on a PC.
It means that I can use a 2Euro ESP8266 board to "remote-serial" this machine;
connect to the ESP8266 over WiFi, and via its serial port, access the Atomic PI
and change BIOS settings, install different distros (or OpenBSD), etc -
<strong>without being physically present next to it</strong>.</p>

<p>Awesome.</p>

<h2>Final solution to power - and an extra USB port.</h2>

<p>But the female 5.5x2.5mm jack still annoyed me. It was a brittle setup;
I didn't like it. I wanted a better, more sturdy solution.</p>

<p>So I ordered a few ingredients for a much better "soup": an adapter I
made that uses male pin headers to give life to the Atomic PI, getting power
from a normal 5.5x2.5mm plug. It also has a switch and a power LED.</p>

<p>And since I did all this and no magic smoke came out, I did one final
augmentation: I soldered a female USB breakout on the "webcam" connector,
since I saw in the schematics that this was in fact a USB 2.0 port:</p>

<p>
<em>Final form - switched on. The cable in the back is the serial cable.</em>
</div>

<p>Yep, there's some hot glue used as well :-) To stabilize, isolate and provide some
strength to the soldered USB port wires.</p>

<p>In fact, that's the thing I am most grateful to Digital Loggers for;
by selling such a cheap Intel-based machine, they allowed me to
break through the "mental block" associated with any Intel HW:</p>

<p><em>"It's not a toy, don't solder anything on it!"</em></p>

<p>Well, I've soldered stuff on Intel-equipped motherboards now.<br>
Guess I've crossed another threshold :-)</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I've shared some of the material above on the Atomic PI subreddit ; but I've decided
that it's far better to write it all down in my blog as well. At the very least
this may help people - by addressing some of their questions, and also showing
them what is possible with the Atomic PI.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a fantastic little machine - and probably the best bargain I've ever
seen, anywhere, in terms of computing power. No other SBC comes close to this
price/performance ratio - if you don't believe me, Google for 
the prices of Intel motherboards equipped with the same processor, then add 2GB of RAM,
and 16GB of EMMC - and compare the result to 35$.</p>

<p>As for how this incredible price was achieved, some rumours indicate the boards
came out from a failed robotics company. In my mind, that makes it even better:
I have here in front of me, the heart of a robot. And though it's a bit sad that 
it didn't amount to what it was meant to... well, at least it will serve me - and 
it will serve me well.</p>

<p>My new Beast smiles at me from across the room, with his green LED indicating that life is good.</p>

<p>I love it :-)</p>
