              <em>(Warning: What follows can barely be classified as drivel; I am usually a
  much more timid person. I wrote it around 2005, when a huge disaster of a 
  project - in which I was yet another mindless drone, executing slow and painful
  self destruct commands from senior mgmt - went down in flames...)</em>

  <p>I'm writing this against my better judgment; deep-down, I
  know that it is an exercise in futility; but I feel I have to do
  it, at least once in my life; express that is, the solitude and
  frustration of a creative mind when it is bound by the "rules of
  conduct" of large corporations.</p>

  <h2>Venting. Steam.</h2>

  <p>You see, one of the things - in fact, the most important one -
  that got me in the IT sector, was the beauty of coding. It
  merged the clarity of mathematics with the usefulness of physics. It
  is one of the few things in life where beauty and functionality
  go hand in hand.</p>

  <p>A good developer writes less code that works faster; sees
  design patterns that get re-used from one project to the next;
  knows when and what to optimize; uses the right tools for each
  problem; writes macros and code generators for tedious and repetitive 
  code. To put it simply, an expensive
  developer - one that sells his/her services at a rate of 2-3 times
  more than the simple-minded market - is actually 10-20 times more
  productive, and thus, much more cost efficient.</p>

  <p>No, this is not an exaggeration. In fact, it is an understatement.

  <p>If you think it is an exaggeration, stop reading now and try a 
  decade of coding for a living.

  <p>This is a rant, so don't expect any "market proof" for the
  previous dogmas or the ones which will follow; I <em>know</em> I
  am right, and I'm guessing that all the experienced developers
  out there already know what I'm talking about.

  <p>So, if that is indeed the case, and efficient people can solve
  IT problems in a cost efficient manner, why am I upset?</p>

  Well...

  <ul>
    <li>They are usually not allowed to do so.</li>

    <li>In most cases, IT managers block the technically optimal solutions,
    in favour of "politically" optimal ones.</li>

    <li>IT management positions are in many cases occupied by people not qualified enough
    to be siting in these seats.</li>

    <li>Even those that are qualified enough, can't/won't take the
    risk to collide with the market forces that usually drive the IT
    sector.</li>

  </ul>If you have any decent background in the IT business, you
  already know what I'm talking about. But lets try making the above concrete,
  with a VERY REAL example:

  <p>Imagine that a large corporation is facing huge problems with
  their already existing systems.
  Their hardware can't keep up with their load;
  their software is old;
  it can't adapt to the ever increasing change requirements.</p>

  <p>What should they do?<br>
  What do they actually do?

  <p>The answers to the previous two questions are almost always,
  way too different.

  <p>What they should do:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Since the corporation people know the business logic they need
    (heck, their technical people have been working with a legacy
    system for ages, and know <em>EXACTLY</em> what they want)</li>

    <li>...and since the bright new (or the experienced old :&#x2011;)
    coders know how to implement any business logic</li>

    <li>their best bet would be for the corporation to implement it
    (either themselves, or through a well-supervised subcontractor that
    will deliver the complete source code) to fit their
    hearts' desires. This would also be the perfect opportunity to
    optimize old algorithms, fit in new hardware, make the problem
    come up to terms with the current state of technology. 
    And possibly, create a brand new team in the process.</li>
  </ul>Not so, I'm afraid.

  <p>What IT managers usually think of:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>"I am a more or less IT-ignorant person who only got in the
    business because of the money."</li>

    <li>"I need to make a fail-safe decision, so that I get to keep
    my chair"</li>

    <li>"I therefore look at what my competitors at the corporation
    across the street do, and propose their solution; if it doesn't
    work, I made a safe decision; no-one will accuse me; if it does
    work, I'll maybe get on the Board. Plus, the resellers of the
    solution employed there might slip me something extra..."</li>

    <li>What the competitors do (thinking exactly the same way) is
    use a VERY expensive system, that some other Mega Corp. is
    also using.</li>

    <li>That very expensive system is a beast; The hardware required to 
    run it makes Crays cry; it can supposedly tackle every problem on 
    the planet, but it can only be customized by the ones that made it. 
    This makes it very expensive. To cut the costs and become 
    cost-effective, customization is sold by the mother of the beast to 
    somewhere in India. This makes customization more or less a nightmare.
  </ul>
  But hey, the manager is getting a good night's sleep. Right?<p>
  Actually, he isn't, because migration to the new system is now facing 
  delays and complaints: the beast is slow, almost as slow as the
  legacy system. It doesn't do what the corporation people want, and
  customization is very slow and introduces bugs. The original
  developer of the beast has sold the product to Beast Inc. and
  lives in Hawaii, so the poor developers have to reverse
  engineer it. This leads to even more bugs.

  <p>Eventually, everybody gets fed up and the corporation returns to the
  legacy system.<br>
  Or accepts the "new" system, which is a bloody nightmare - even
  more so than the legacy system (and fires the incompetent managers,
  who cheerfully migrate to their next nest... or become employed 
  by the "Mega Beast Corp".<p>
  ....<p>
  I have personally been involved in projects where a team of 5
  competent engineers could have completed a blazingly fast new
  system in record time. The system would have satisfied the
  customer's demands (and would have done so for the next decade
  at least).<br>
  The customer however (in fact, the customer's managers) always
  chooses to go the "Mega Beast Corp" way and employ a battalion of
  "consultants".</p>

  <p>Perhaps they are justified in their thinking. Perhaps they have 
  been burned in the past when they tried to do it "in-house". 
  Perhaps a devious subcontractor managed to exercise extortion 
  last time they tried upgrading, and demanded outrageous fees for 
  adding an edit box in a form.

  <p>Regardless of the reasons, the result is almost always the same: 
  <p><b>Forget</b> what I said in the beginning, about beauty and efficiency.</p>

  <p>Meet living hell, meet hacks, meet the software equivalent of
  tons of stitching tape to make the Mega Beast Hippopotamus stable
  enough.</p>

  <p>In the end, of course, it turns out that the ones that actually 
  do the work are still bright people; only geniuses can cope with 
  mapping the Beast to the customer's needs.</p>

  <p>But even they, despair sometimes.<br>
  And their lives could have been so much easier.<br>
  Their clients' lives, too.</p>
