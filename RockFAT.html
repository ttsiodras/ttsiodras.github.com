  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  I make a living writing code. There is no
  simpler way of putting it. And living a life messed up with bits
  and bytes, I am bound to face the inevitable need to transfer
  them. Be it from work to home, from the company labs to the
  client's machines or just copying them for backup purposes, the
  time comes when I have to move them somehow.

  <p>In the Internet age, these transfers are mostly done through
  e-mail attachments or ftp/www servers. Which means that both
  source and destination machines must have access to the Web.</p>

  <p>What do you do when this isn't the case?</p>

  <p>You could burn CD-Rs for your files - even though most of the
  time, your data amounts to less than 5 MB (assuming of course
  that you have the necessary equipment inside your computer). If
  you don't (like me), you could kindly ask your company's sysadmin
  to do it for you. But what if this happens on a daily basis? You
  can't constantly bother your sysadmin (unless you want to
  suddenly see that your computer's web access became rather...
  slow :&#x2011;) So you do the brave thing, you just compress your files
  in a couple of disks, and take them with you. Right?</p>

  <p>Sadly, this world is governed by Murphy's law. 9 times out of
  10, one of your diskettes will have a defective sector or two,
  which ruins the whole set. Even if you use archivers that employ
  some kind of error correction (like <i>rar</i>, from Eugene
  Roshal) you basically cross your fingers and hope for the
  best.</p>

  <p>Until now.</p>

  <h2>Algorithm</h2>To be honest, I had this idea about
  strengthening diskettes for more than a couple of years, but as
  always, there never was enough time to code this.

  <p>The basic plot is that with error correcting codes, like for
  example <b>Reed-Solomon</b>, one can use <i>parity</i> bytes to
  protect a block of data. For my needs, I chose a block of 232
  bytes, added 24 bytes of parity (totaling approximately 10% of
  excess information), and was able to correct up to 12 erroneous
  bytes inside the 232-byte block. You'd argue of course that a
  diskette is a block device, that works or fails on 512-byte
  sector boundaries. True. So all we have to do, is to simply
  interleave the stream inside the diskette's sectors, in the
  following way:</p>

  <div align="center">
    <table cellpadding="3" border="1" summary="Data interleaving">
      <tr>
        <td align="right">1st byte of stream</td>

        <td align="left">first byte of first sector</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td align="right">2nd byte of stream</td>

        <td align="left">first byte of second sector</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td align="right">...</td>

        <td align="left">...</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td align="right">2879th byte of stream</td>

        <td align="left">first byte of last sector</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td align="right">2880th byte of stream</td>

        <td align="left">second byte of first sector</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td align="right">2881st byte of stream</td>

        <td align="left">second byte of second sector</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td align="right">...</td>

        <td align="left">...</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  <p>This way, if a sector is defective, you only lose <b>one</b>
  byte inside your 232-byte block for each of the 512 blocks that
  pass through that sector - and the algorithm can handle 12 of
  those errors per block! Taking into account the fact that sector
  errors are local events (in terms of diskette space), an even
  better way to interleave is this:</p>

  <div align="center">
    <table cellpadding="3" border="1" summary=
    "Error-locality counteracted">
      <tr>
        <td align="right">1st byte of stream</td>

        <td align="left">first byte of first sector</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td align="right">2nd byte of stream</td>

        <td align="left">first byte of Nth sector</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td align="right">...</td>

        <td align="left">...</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td align="right">(2880/N) byte of stream</td>

        <td align="left">first byte of second sector</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td align="right">((2880/N)+1) byte of stream</td>

        <td align="left">first byte of (2+N)th sector</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td align="right">...</td>

        <td align="left">...</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  <p>...where N is a parameter (in my test implementation, I used
  N=8).</p>

  <h2>Results</h2>Since we use sectors directly, there is of course
  no concept of a filesystem on the diskette (unless you regard my
  scheme as one - lets name it RockFAT :&#x2011;) By the way, utilizing
  this scheme you can use diskettes with bad sectors at the
  beginning, which are quite useless with FAT ("Track 0 bad - Disk
  unusable" is what you get when formating such disks). Anyway, we
  use 232 out of 256 bytes for data, so we have <i>2880 sectors X
  512 bytes X (232/256) = 1336320</i> bytes available. In my test
  implementation, I also reserved 20 bytes at the beginning of the
  stream for a 4-byte stream length, and a 16-byte filename.

  <p>So, all you have to do when transferring your files, is to
  instruct your compression utility (<b>rar</b> or <b>arj</b> or
  whatever) to create 1336300-byte blocks. You then transfer these
  files to your diskettes in the way I described, and you can stop
  worrying about bad sectors - if it happens, you'll still get your
  data, at a very high probability (To lose data, your diskette
  must have 12 bad sectors on 8-sector intervals, for example:
  sectors 0,8,16,..,96 must be bad. Quite unlikely, unless you play
  baseball with your diskettes).</p>

  <h2>Conclusion - Download</h2>Don't throw away your "Track 0 bad"
  diskettes! Don't pest your company's sysadmin! Just use RockFAT
  :&#x2011;)

  <p>Seriously, this idea can obviously be implemented for other
  mediums - even be a true filesystem, in the ext2 and NTFS sense.
  Go ahead and implement it to your heart's desire.</p>

  <p>A sample implementation for Windows (and Linux, through
  <tt>dd</tt> usage) is available (.7z stands for <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/">7-zip</a>):</p>
