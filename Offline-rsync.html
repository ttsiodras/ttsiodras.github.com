              <em>(March 2007)</em>

  <h2>The problem statement</h2>Picture this:

  <p>A lowly developer splits his working time between home and the
  company premises. He uses the following routine: at the end of
  the working day at home/company, he compresses the source tree
  and picks it up on his USB stick. At company/home, he
  decompresses the package and hacks on.</p>

  <p>This procedure is starting to show some issues, however. For
  one, the data barely fit in the USB stick, even compressed. He is
  contemplating a bigger USB stick (maybe one of the new USB hard
  drives), but even if he uses that, the problem is that the
  procedure takes too long: the repository snapshot he works on is huge,
  and compressing it and taking it with him simply takes too
  long.</p>

  <p>Of course, if this developer had a fast Internet access at
  home, he could use <a href=
  "http://www.samba.org/rsync">rsync</a>; that is, provided that
  the company allows remote access at all - but does it?</p>

  <p>And, naturally, the changes he makes daily couldn't
  <em>possibly</em> be <em>that</em> big - why should he take a
  whole source tree every time?</p>

  <p>He defends himself, saying that he must be absolutely certain
  that everything is updated, and that he couldn't just take
  <em>patch</em> files for his work, since other parts of the tree
  are updated by others. What else could he do?</p>

  <p>Well, there is something...</p>

  <h2>Hello, rdiff</h2>Obviously, rsync can't be used unless both
  the work machine and the home machine are connected on a network.
  The rsync algorithm, however, is quite ingenious. You can read
  all about it 
  <a href="http://www.samba.org/rsync/tech_report/">here</a>. The
  amazing thing is, that <b>simultaneous access to both "files to
  synchronize" is not necessary</b>. The algorithm takes a
  "snapshot" of file A stored in machine 1, in terms of block-based
  CRCs. It then sends these CRCs over the network to machine 2,
  where they are used to compute the differences with file B.
  Finally, the differences are sent in the opposite direction, to
  update file A.

  <p>What if we didn't use the network to send the CRCs and the
  differences?<br>
  What if we just stored them, inside, say, a USB stick?</p>

  <p>That's exactly the idea that rdiff implements. You can
  download the source code and compile it for yourself 
  <a href="http://librsync.sourceforge.net/">here</a> (as part of
  librsync), or get it pre-compiled for your platform (under
  Debian, <tt>apt-get install rdiff</tt> is enough).</p>

  <p>Here is a simple example of its usage, to update a single
  file:</p>
  <pre class="o">
(At home)
<b>/home/jdoe/code$</b> rdiff signature SrcFileA.c SrcFileA.c.signature
(The CRCs of the blocks in file SrcFileA.c are now stored 
 in SrcFileA.c.signature. You take the .signature file to work)

(At work)
<b>/home/JohnDoe/code$</b> rdiff delta SrcFileA.c.signature \
	SrcFileA.c SrcFileA.c.delta
(Using the CRCs calculated at home, find the differences of the 
 work file and store them in SrcFileA.c.delta)

(Back home)
<b>/home/jdoe/code$</b> rdiff patch SrcFileA.c SrcFileA.c.delta \
	SrcFileA.c.new
(update SrcFileA.c to SrcFileA.c.new using the deltas)
</pre>Right!<br>
  It works, but... do we really have to go through all this, just to
  synchronize a single file? The source tree has thousands of files,
  inside a huge tree!

  <h2>Automation scripts</h2>Naturally, no-one in
  their right mind would ever attempt to go through this procedure manually
  for a large tree of files. The lowly developer I described above is 
  actually me, so at some point (during a very boring series of 
  presentations I had to attend) I wrote 3 perl scripts to automate 
  the process.

  <p>The results are depicted in the "screenshot" below:</p>
  <pre class="o">
(At home)
<b>/home/jdoe/code$</b> snapOldData.pl SrcTree/
<b>/home/jdoe/code$</b> ls -lF
drwxr-xr-x     7 jdoe coder 0 Mar 24 13:07 SrcTree/
-rw-r--r-- 12345 jdoe coder 0 Mar 24 13:07 SrcTree.signs.tar.bz2
<b>/home/jdoe/code$</b> cp SrcTree.signs.tar.bz2 /mnt/usbstick/

(At work)
<b>/home/JohnDoe/code$</b> cp /mnt/usbstick/SrcTree.signs.tar.bz2 .
<b>/home/JohnDoe/code$</b> createDeltas.pl work/ SrcTree.signs.tar.bz2
<b>/home/JohnDoe/code$</b> ls -lF
drwxr-xr-x     7 jdoe coder 0 Mar 24 13:07 work/
-rw-r--r-- 12345 jdoe coder 0 Mar 24 13:07 work.deltas.tar.bz2
-rw-r--r-- 12345 jdoe coder 0 Mar 24 13:07 SrcTree.signs.tar.bz2
<b>/home/JohnDoe/code$</b> rm /mnt/usbstick/SrcTree.signs.tar.bz2
<b>/home/JohnDoe/code$</b> cp work.deltas.tar.bz2 /mnt/usbstick/

(Back home)
<b>/home/jdoe/code$</b> cp /mnt/usbstick/work.deltas.tar.bz2 .
<b>/home/jdoe/code$</b> applyDeltas.pl work.deltas.tar.bz2 SrcTree/
</pre>The scripts will also update the home work tree with all the
new files that have appeared, and they will keep a backup of the
files changed (with the extension .rdiff_oldVersion) so that you
can revert to your old versions if you so wish.
