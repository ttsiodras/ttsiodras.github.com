<b>TL; DR: Another magnificent little SBC - based on an RK3308, and running in 64bit. I like it.</b>
</div>

<p>What? Another SBC?!?</p>

<p>Well... what can I say? I <a target="_blank" href="thebeast.html#thebeast">have</a> a
<a target="_blank" href="atomicpi.html">weakness</a> for these machines :-)</p>

<p>Nerdy addictions are difficult to trace - but I suspect that the origins of this particular
obsession can be traced to my first-ever computer: the magnificent
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum#ZX_Spectrum_16K.2F48K" target="_blank">ZX Spectrum</a>.
A machine from a more civilized era - when men were men, wrote their own drivers, and had no fear of "the guts" of machines.</p>

<p>Let's have a look at the "guts" of the ROCK&nbsp;PI&nbsp;S :-)</p>

<h2>The hardware</h2>

<p>I received this new toy a few days ago - courtesy of
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.seeedstudio.com/ROCK-PI-S-Mini-Computer-with-Rockchip-RK3308-512MB-RAM-4Gb-NAND-Flash-p-4282.html">Seeed Studio</a>.</p>

<div style="clear:both; text-align:center; margin: 0em 0em 0em 0em">
<img src="RockPIS1.jpg" alt="I don't have giant hands - it really is this tiny :-)"><p>
<em>I don't have giant hands - it really is this tiny :-)</em>
</div>

<p>What's inside?</p>

<ul>
<li>RK3308 Quad A35 64bit CPU</li>
<li>256MB or 512MB RAM. My board is the 512MB model, costing ~12 Euros at the time I am writing this.</li>
<li>USB 2.0 OTG (type-C) and a separate USB 2.0 type-A port</li>
<li>RJ45 10/100Mbit Ethernet</li>
<li>802.11 b/g/n Wifi + bluetooth 4.0 with external antenna connector (antenna not included)</li>
<li>26 pin GPIO header</li>
<li>26 pin voice/audio header (I2C, PCM, TDM, PDM, SPDIF, and HDMI ARC)</li>
<li>Dimensions of 1.7 x 1.7 inch (~38.1mm x 38.1mm)</li>
</ul>

<p>Since I don't have USB-C equipment, I used a simple micro-USB to USB-C adapter to power up
the board:</p>

<div style="clear:both; text-align:center; margin: 0em 0em 0em 0em">
<img src="RockPIS2.jpg" alt="With a micro-USB to USB-C adapter"><p>
<em>With a micro-USB to USB-C adapter</em>
</div>

<p>As I do with all my SBCs, I then setup access to the primary serial port. This is very important;
it allows me to interact with the board as early as possible (at boot time),
and perform anything necessary to setup the network - to allow easier access (over SSH).</p>

<p>Since this is a 3.3V device, I used my PL2303HX adapter...</p>

<div style="clear:both; text-align:center; margin: 0em 0em 0em 0em">
<img src="RockPIS3.jpg" alt="USB-to-TTL adapter. Just connect TX/RX and GND"><p>
<em>USB-to-TTL adapter. Just connect TX/RX and GND</em>
</div>

<p>...and after reading the documentation, connected it to pins 6 (GND), 8 (USB RX) and 10 (USB TX):</p>

</div>

<h2>The software</h2>

<p>That took care of the HW setup. But what SW should we run on this tiny machine?</p>

<p>At a high level, there are basically two options with most SBCs <em>(including this one)</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Either you trust the makers of the board with the custom distributions they build (including Android ones)</li>
<li>...or you trust <a target="_blank" href="https://www.armbian.com/">Armbian</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am on the second camp - mostly because <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.armbian.com/Developer-Guide_Using-Vagrant/">I can build the entire, flashable Armbian distribution for my targets from source</a>. This is what I did - and if you have enough experience with Linux and embedded devices, you can do so relatively easily. It involves booting a from-scratch Ubuntu-bionic VM (via Vagrant), and following the build instructions. The Armbian developers have documented everything you need; and note also that the <strong>ROCK PI S</strong> is indeed shown in the list displayed from <code>compile.sh</code>. Choosing it, the build machinery will download the source code and compile the entire Armbian distribution from scratch, creating an image for flashing.</p>

<p>Then again, if you trust the Armbian developers, you can simply download the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.armbian.com/radxa-rockpi-s/">pre-built image</a> - and then "flash" it in any micro SD card. With the Debian one, you'd execute something like this:</p>

<pre><code># ls -l *img
-rw-r--r--   1 ttsiod users 1518338048 Jan 20 07:02
     Armbian_20.02.0-rc0_Rockpi-s_buster_legacy_4.4.207.img

# dd if=Armbian_20.02.0-rc0_Rockpi-s_buster_legacy_4.4.207.img \
    bs=1M oflag=sync status=progress of=/dev/sdc
</code></pre>

<p>In the example invocation above, my SD card is under /dev/sdc - make sure you
use the appropriate target here, <strong>otherwise you will wipe out your own machine's
data!</strong> The output of <code>dmesg</code> is your friend here, look at it (and the output
of <code>lsblk</code>) to see the name of the device for your SD.</p>

<p>The <code>sync</code> output flag of <code>dd</code> caused a significant improvement in reliability with
my SD writer. You may or may not need this option - but if you don't use it,
make sure you actually invoke <code>sync</code> after <code>dd</code> is complete. And you will definitely
benefit from a big block size (<code>bs=1M</code>) and a nice and simple progress report
while the writing takes place (<code>status=progress</code>).</p>

<h2>Booting Armbian</h2>

<p>After that, plugging in the USB-to-TTL adapter shows a new serial port under <code>/dev/ttyUSB0</code>;
and the ROCKPIS is running it at 1.5MBits per second, so we launch <code>minicom</code>
with that baudrate - and see Armbian boot:</p>

<p><center>
<a href="https://asciinema.org/a/295903" target="_blank"><img src="https://asciinema.org/a/295903.svg" /></a>
</center></p>

<p><em>(This recording in fact shows my 2nd login - after I've completed the setup and
rebooted to see it all work from scratch. In the first boot, you must login as <code>root</code>,
with the password <code>1234</code> - after which Armbian will take care of the remaining setup
actions - and therefore be able to reset your password.
More importantly, you'll also be able to connect to your network! In my case,
I easily connected to my Wi-Fi via <code>nmtui-connect</code>.</em></p>

<h2>Benchmarking CPU performance</h2>

<p>After that, I could connect to the ROCK PI S over SSH - and benchmark the device with my <a href="renderer.html">renderer</a>.</p>

<pre><code># apt install libsdl1.2-dev
# wget -q -O - https://github.com/ttsiodras/renderer/archive/v2.3b.tar.gz \
    | tar zxvf -
# cd renderer-2.3b
# ./configure
# make -j4
...
# make bench
</code></pre>

<p>My renderer uses all available cores, and stresses the memory and the FPU a lot.
You can see results from all kinds of machines running it via the <a href="https://openbenchmarking.org/showdown/pts/ttsiod-renderer">Phoronix</a>
test suite.</p>

<p>In terms of the results on my SBCs:</p>

<p>My <strong>Orange PI Zero</strong>, scored 21 frames per
second and rose its temperature above 80C - which forced me to <a target="_blank" href="thebeast.html#thebeast">install a fan to keep it cool</a>...</p>

<pre><code>Average value: 21.027340
Std deviation: 0.037930
       Median: 21.017200
          Min: 20.979300
          Max: 21.082800
</code></pre>

<p>My <strong>Raspberry PI2</strong> reached 58C - and scored 17fps...</p>

<pre><code>Average value: 17.306140
Std deviation: 0.199651
       Median: 17.401600
          Min: 17.064300
          Max: 17.479500
</code></pre>

<p>What about the newcomer? Well, the <strong>ROCK PI S</strong> scored 70% higher than the Raspberry...</p>

<pre><code>Average value: 26.767120
Std deviation: 0.913838
       Median: 26.068800
          Min: 25.376800
          Max: 27.731600
</code></pre>

<p>...with a temperature that didn't exceed 76C (shown via <code>armbianmonitor -m</code>).</p>

<p>Very decent result. For its price, this is a nice, 64 bit machine, with
more than adequate power for all kinds of IoT processing.</p>

<h2>Benchmarking storage</h2>

<p>I then wanted to check USB storage performance,
so I connected an externally powered USB hub, with a 1TB USB drive
attached. I could then measure USB transfer speeds.</p>

<p>Now, I know the port is a USB2 one - but I wanted to see how close we are to the theoretical
maximums. After half a minute of <code>dd</code>-ing raw data (thus avoiding
any seek overheads and seeing the fastest possible result), I got
something close to 31MBytes/second:</p>

<pre><code>root@rockpi:~# dd if=/dev/sda bs=1M | pv  &gt; /dev/null 
1.02GiB 0:00:34 [30.8MiB/s]
</code></pre>

<p>Not stellar - but then again, this isn't a machine made to be a NAS.
For what it is, the ability to connect USB2 peripherals is very 
welcome.</p>

<h2>Power consumption</h2>

<p>Putting my USB power meter in the loop, I measured the current going
in. During boot, this spiked up to around 300mA - and then settled
down in idle, to around 80mA.</p>

<p>Put differently: 0.08A x 5V = 0,4W. <strong>400mWatt</strong>!</p>

<p>Very impressive!... Things have really changed since I last measured this;
I didn't keep a detailed journal like I did for this board, but
I believe the Orange PI Zero was somewhere around 250mA - more than 3 times this
little guy.</p>

<p>As for the consumption during the other benchmarks:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>when stress-testing with my renderer loading all CPUs at 100% and fully using
the floating point unit on all of them, the current consumption reached a
ceiling of 370mA.  Simply put, the maximum consumption I managed to force on
the ROCK PI S, was a bit less than 2W.</p></li>
<li><p>When maximising the USB bus usage with <code>dd</code> from an external 1TB drive,
the current consumption topped at 150mA (0.75W)</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>I haven't yet "played" with all features offered by this board - but my overall
impression so far is very <strong>positive</strong>. Given the price of 12 Euros,
this machine definitely outperforms my Orange PI Zero (which is
basically the only competitor at the same level). It consumes 2x-3x less
energy, runs 70% faster, and it's also running at 64bit (which could
result in even better comparison results when doing integer arithmetic).
I try to avoid this kind of comparisons, though [1]. You don't need
them to see that this is very decent IoT hardware.</p>

<p>I love it that one can buy such machines for this kind of prices - and
delegate peripheral processing to "edge" computing. </p>

<p>I just wish one could avoid the shipping costs from China. If you do
decide to 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.seeedstudio.com/ROCK-PI-S-Mini-Computer-with-Rockchip-RK3308-512MB-RAM-4Gb-NAND-Flash-p-4282.html">buy this board</a>, I humbly suggest that you amortize the shipping cost by bundling more
goodies in the basket.</p>

<p>It's a good excuse to buy even more things - no? :-)</p>

<p>&nbsp;<p></p>

<p>[1] <em>The reason I avoid <code>sysbench</code>, <code>dhrystones</code> and the like, is because they really aren't representative "loads". My <a href="https://openbenchmarking.org/showdown/pts/ttsiod-renderer">renderer</a> is a far better overall stress tester - checking the performance of integer and FPU calculations, done by multiple cores, while at the same time stress-testing the memory bandwidth.</em></p>
