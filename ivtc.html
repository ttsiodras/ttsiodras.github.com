  <i>My NTSC deinterlacing filters, based on the excellent work of Donald Graft
  (author of Decomb)</i>

  <p><b>Filters current Version:</b></p>

  <ul>
    <li>ivtc 0.4.1 (part of transcode 0.6.12)</li>

    <li>decimate 0.4 (part of transcode 0.6.12)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>Before we start, lets clear up the field a bit.</p>

  <p>You DO NOT need any of the two filters (telecide and decimate)
  if you are working with "pure interlaced data" as opposed to
  "artificially interlaced data". In plain terms: You don't need
  these two filters AND YOU SHOULD NOT USE THEM if your source data
  are coming from:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>a decrypted PAL DVD (all European DVDs, for example)</li>

    <li>a captured .avi from a camera (be it PAL or NTSC)</li>
  </ul>For the above, you can use one of the other filters, like
  "-J dilyuvmmx", "-I 1" or "-I 3" (or even smartdeinter). Just
  remember to read the instructions.

  <p>Now that we've thrown away 90% of the readers, its time to
  describe what is this artificial interlacing we (might) meet in
  an NTSC DVD and why it requires special care.</p>

  <h2>23.976 -&gt; 29.97</h2>NTSC television is broadcast at 29.97
  frames per second. Films however, (movies) are shot at 24 frames
  per second. How are Americans watching movies on their TVs then?
  Where do the extra 5.97 frames come from? :&#x2011;)

  <p>As one might guess, American engineers had to interpolate.
  They also had to cope with the fact that TV isn't actually
  showing 29.97 frames per sec, but 2 x 29.97 fields per second.
  What are fields, you ask? Well, check this ASCII art:</p>
  <pre>
scanline 0 --------------------------------- Field 0, 1st line
scanline 1 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Field 1, 1st line
scanline 2 --------------------------------- Field 0, 2nd line
scanline 3 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Field 1, 2nd line
scanline 4 --------------------------------- Field 0, 3rd line
</pre>
etc...

  <p>As you can see, each frame is composed from two fields. Each
  of the fields has 240 lines, thus we finally get 480 scanlines.
  So, to display film content, which is 24 frames per second, this
  is what American engineers came up with:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>First, each film frame is split into two fields. We thus
    get 48 fields per second (2 x 24)</li>

    <li>Then, a process called 3:2 pulldown (telecine) is
    performed, which "stretches" the 48 fields into the desired
    number.</li>
  </ul>It's better to see it with an example: Assume we have 5 film
  frames, now split into 10 fields. The even scanlines are forming
  the 'top' fields, while the odd ones the 'bottom'. For example,
  the two first frames are split as follows:
  <pre>
    Frame 1                        Frame 2                         
    =======                        =======
    Top Field of Frame 1    (T1)   Top Field of Frame 2    (T2)    
    Bottom Field of Frame 1 (B1)   Bottom Field of Frame 2 (B2)
</pre>Now, if we had a 24fps Television set, we could see any film
easily, if we sent it the following sequence:
  <pre>
    T1 B1   T2 B2   T3 B3   T4 B4   T5 B5   T6 B6 ...
    ======  ======  ======  ======  ======  ====== 
    Frame1  Frame2  Frame3  Frame4  Frame5  Frame6
</pre>Unfortunately, we have a stupid 29.97 standard, so this is
what we send:
  <pre>
    T1 B1 T2 B2 T2 B3 T3 B4 T4 B4 ...
    ===== ===== ===== ===== =====
      N     N     A     A     N
</pre>As you can see, we have used fields from 4 film frames, but
we have sent them in a way that produces 5 NTSC 'frames': 3 Normal
(N) ones, and two Artificial (A) ones. The displaying is also
slowed down, from 30 'frames' per sec to 29.97 fps.

  <p>You see it? These Artificial frames are horribly interlaced!
  And this interlacing has nothing to do with the normal
  interlacing found in PAL and NTSC cameras... This is a different
  monster.</p>

  <p>Note that if you use one of transcode's deinterlacing filters
  with such a sequence, you'll probably get something like
  this:</p>
  <pre>
    T1 B1 T2 B2 T3 B3 T4 B4 T4 B4 ...
    ===== ===== ===== ===== =====
</pre>... that is, two completely identical frames (IF the
deinterlacing algorithm is good enough). And yes, when you encode
your sequence to MPEG4 or whatever, you waste bandwidth for these
extra frames. Not to mention, that a skilled eye will notice that
the film is not natural - any motion will appear jerky, because of
the duplicate frames.

  <p>Did I mention that this pattern shifts and jumps throughout
  the video? In other words, this scheme is not constant; Video
  editing is performed on fields, and if the DVD authoring studio
  deletes a series of fields in the middle of the film, the
  eventual field order is impossible to predict...</p>

  <h3>What can we do?</h3>Well, first of all, as good as transcode
  deinterlacing filters are, they were not designed for this
  atrocity. Even "-I 3" falls back to keeping odd (or even)
  scanlines and interpolates them to get the ones missing. This is
  unacceptable.

  <p>The recovery process (called IVTC - inverse telecine) is done
  in two steps, from two filters. The first one, called 'ivtc',
  tries to recreate the original film frames from the available
  fields. It doesn't remove the duplicate frames; this is done from
  the next filter, the 'decimate' one.</p>

  <p>The algorithms used in these filters are the basic ones used
  in the 'Decomb' package (made by Donald A. Graft and available -
  unfortunately - only under Windows). Thanks for opening up the
  source, Donald!</p>

  <h3>Example</h3>To summarize, let's see an example. The Dolby
  trailers are freely available on the Web, and yes, they are
  purely telecined. Let's transcode 'City' in a two pass perfect
  IVTC with Ogg sound:
  <pre class="o">
First pass:
transcode -M 0 -f 23.976       -i dolby-city.vob -x vob \
    -y xvid,null \
    -w 740 -J ivtc,decimate -V -o /dev/null -R 1 -B 6,13,16 

Second pass:
transcode -M 0 -f 23.976 -b 64 -i dolby-city.vob -x vob \
    -y xvid,ogg  \
    -w 740 -J ivtc,decimate -V -o test.avi  -R 2 -m test.ogg \
    -B 6,13,16 
</pre>Adding video and audio together in an Ogg stream (you'll need
ogmtools):
  <pre class="o">
ogmmerge -o dolby-city.ogm test.avi test.ogg
</pre>Some explaining:
  <pre>
 -w 740         Target video bitrate is 740000 bits per second

 -B 6,13,16     Resize from NTSC 720x480 to 512x384 (4:3 aspect)
 
 -M 0 -f 23.976 it means that the demux must not drop frames on
                its own; the filters will do that, producing a
                23.976 frames per sec result.
                    
 -J ivtc,decimate Always use them in this order, and with no 
                  other filter before them - especially no 
		  deinterlacing and no resizing one!
</pre>

  <h3>Problems</h3>As good as these filters are, there are streams
  out there that are simply impossible to IVTC. For example,
  amazing as it may sound, some NTSC DVDs are switching from 29.97
  to 23.976 IN THE MIDDLE of playback! When there is no constant
  frame rate, the filters will fail.

  <p>Additionally, when the telecine pattern shifts (as a result
  of, maybe, field editing by the DVD authors) a couple of
  interlaced frames will pass through. These should be deinterlaced
  on their own. You shouldn't use global deinterlacing after ivtc -
  it would blur out the otherwise perfect progressive frames that
  get reconstructed from 'ivtc'. However, transcode's '32detect'
  filter comes to the rescue: It first checks whether the frame is
  interlaced, and only then it forces a frame deinterlacing. So,
  this is what I recommend for your sessions:</p>
  <pre class="o">
transcode -M 0 -f 23.976 \
	-J ivtc,32detect=force_mode=3,decimate ...
</pre>To put it simply, 'ivtc' will try to fix the paranoia of
telecine. When the pattern shifts (or the algorithm fails) a couple
of interlaced frames will slip-by, which are detected and
deinterlaced by '32detect'. Finally, the 29.97 frames produced for
every second of input are fed into 'decimate', which removes the
extra frame.

  <p>Hope all this hasn't caused you a headache. If your NTSC DVD
  contains a film, chances are these filters will help.</p>

  <p>Since they work perfectly for my NTSC DVDs, I probably won't
  mess them up anymore.<br>
  Feel free to change them as you will, as they are available under
  the GPL.</p>
