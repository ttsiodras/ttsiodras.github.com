            <p>Dear Recruiter,</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting me. I appreciate your efforts in trying to match
people with a specific skillset with the requirements of a position; a daunting
task indeed.</p>

<p>And perhaps I am indeed a good match for what you have in mind.</p>

<p>But to avoid wasting your time as well as mine, I'll need you to provide answers
to the following topics. If you can't, or don't have the time to, then there's
no point in discussing any further; it means I am not the kind of candidate you
want.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What are the HW and SW targets of the position? If this is a position about
embedded systems, an example would be "the target is an ARM Cortex-R
platform running vxWorks, and we're looking into someone that can write the
application SW for it in C++. We also need to communicate with the system at
run-time via CAN bus and receive some data over UART links".</p></li>
<li><p>Is the location of the position in the Netherlands? If not, is there a relocation package?</p></li>
<li><p>How many years has the company been around? I've worked for both startups
and big enterprises, and they each have their advantages. Point me to
financial results if this is about a company with some history; point me to the
capital behind it if its a startup.</p></li>
<li><p>Prior to joining the European Space Agency, I've owned a startup for 12
years. In that time, I've delivered my development services to a wide array
of targets - ranging from low-level device drivers, to real-time optimization
of space missions' algorithms, to parsing and code generation, to web
interfaces accessing complex business logic...  In a very real sense, I've done
a lot of things. Point your clients to my <a href="cv.pdf">CV</a> - is this variety an asset for the
position or not? I fully understand that you may want to target the "cheap, young
crowd" - in which case, I'd hate to waste your time.</p></li>
<li><p>A very good filter is asking the company how they feel about me by looking
at my free-time endeavours - <a href="https://www.thanassis.space">my site</a> has featured prominently in Slashdot, Hacker News,
Reddit/programming, etc. Am I the kind of person they'd like to have? e.g. point
them <a href="https://www.thanassis.space/android.html">to this article</a>,
and ask them if having a person in their workforce that does these things 
just for fun, is an asset or not.</p></li>
<li><p>Given the country and the tax status of the position, what is the expected
NET income from it, for a single male? In addition to what is said above, note
that I am not married, have no kids, and have no problem working long hours.
I dedicate all my efforts into my work - but expect to be well compensated for it.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Please answer as many of these questions as possible. The final question in particular 
is mandatory; if you don't answer that one, there's no point in discussing any
further.</p>

<p>Thanks again for your time, and your interest in me.</p>

<p>Kind regard,
Thanassis.</p>
