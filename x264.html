              <em>(Original, February 2005)</em><br>
  <em>(Updated, August 2006, new script keeps audio/video sync and creates VOBSUB subtitle files)</em><br>
  <em>(Updated, August 2007, <A HREF="vobs2mkv.pl.diff">patch</A> contributed from Benjamin Pineau for latest versions of mplayer and mkvmerge)</em><br>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  The issue of taking DVD backups has been
  a matter of controversy, over both legal and technical
  issues. I have been monitoring the latter kind (the technical)
  ever since I was a student. Some of my free time is still spent
  in following the technical innovations in the area, trying to
  keep up with the best possible way of transcoding MPEG2 (a.k.a
  DVD), in terms of balancing quality of the output with speed of
  transcoding.

  <p>For the last couple of years, I had settled on using:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>XVID for video</li>

    <li>Ogg Vorbis for audio</li>

    <li>Matroska for multiplexing</li>
  </ul>...through the usage of excellent open source tools
  (transcode, oggenc, mkvmerge). I even contributed some code to
  the <b>transcode</b> project for handling NTSC <a href="ivtc.html">
  telecined</a> DVDs.<br>
  The reasons for these choices were simple:

  <ul>
    <li>No codec was better than XVID in all the codec comparisons.
    It was one of the best in terms of quality, and it was also the
    fastest.</li>

    <li>Ogg Vorbis was also a no-brainer: even at 96 Kbits per
    second, Ogg Vorbis audio quality is comparable to MP3
    128Kbps!</li>

    <li>Matroska, finally, is the OPTIMAL container: overhead is
    only 0.25 percent of the final size and you can multiplex
    everything (video, audio, text and VOBSUB subtitles) in one
    file (AVI is hideous, with an overhead of 24 bytes per -- frame
    -- yuck).</li>
  </ul>Recently, however, one of the parameters changed: MPEG4 has
  now been obsoleted in terms of quality/bitrate by a new codec:
  <b>H264</b>.<br>
  To give you an idea of what can be accomplished, utilizing open
  source implementations, one can now encode 2,5 hours of
  acceptable audiovisual quality in just one 700MB CD!

  <p>I found some spare time, so I'll show you how to do it -- the
  relevant information up to now is kinda sketchy (to put it mildly
  :&#x2011;) However, I will only describe the crux of it, and no, please
  don't start asking me stuff. This is only for people who have a
  working knowledge of both UNIX and video matters, so if you don't
  know what an aspect ratio is, or why 0.2 bits per pixel is the
  lowest limit of acceptable MPEG4 quality, stop reading this now
  (while you're ahead :&#x2011;).<br>
  Sorry, but making a living writing software takes almost all of
  my time.</p>

  <p>P.S. You 'll also get a Perl script to assist the work.</p>

  <h2>2. Prerequisites</h2>I'm only doing this as a hobby, so I
  won't research into any other versions of the tools: use the same
  version that I am, or adapt the Perl script yourself.

  <ul>
    <li>mplayer/mencoder<br>
    <em>Mplayer 1.0pre8</em> with x264 support. If you compile it yourself, 
    you'll first need to get x264, through a subversion repository<br>
    (<tt>svn co svn://svn.videolan.org/x264/trunk x264</tt>).</li>

    <li>tcscan<br>
    (transcode-0.6.14)</li>

    <li>oggenc<br>
    (vorbis-tools-1.0.1)</li>

    <li>mkvmerge<br>
    (mkvtoolnix-1.6.5))</li>

    <li>mpegdemux<br>
    (mpegdemux-0.1.2)(only required if you use the Perl <a href=
    "x264.html#script">script</a>)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Encoding</h2>Even though I have been using 'transcode' for
  most of my hobby tests, it doesn't support H264 (not yet). Hence,
  we are forgetting about distributed encodes (for now :&#x2011;) and are
  going to do it through the significant other, <b>mencoder</b>.

  <p>We'll tackle a rather advanced example, transcoding an NTSC
  telecined Dolby trailer, called <tt>dolby-city.vob</tt>. You can
  google the filename, it will immediately show up. Its rather big
  for plain modems though (27MB), so you can try to follow through
  these instructions with your preferred VOB anyway.</p>

  <p>Naturally, if you want to encode DVD data, you'll have to
  store the unencrypted MPEG2 data somewhere; I'm assuming you know
  how to circumvent the CSS encryption to get to the MPEG2 data you
  want.  <tt>mplayer -dumpstream dvd://1</tt> can lead to legal 
  troubles in certain countries, so make sure you are not breaking 
  any laws doing it...</p>

  <p>Most of what follows is automated through a Perl script I
  made, but since you are reading this I'm guessing you want to
  know the details :&#x2011;)<br>
  Click <a href="x264.html#script">here</a> to skip explanations
  and just use the script.</p>

  <p>Let's assume that your MPEG2 data are stored in a directory
  called video:</p>
  <pre class="o">
<b>heaven:/var/tmp/video$</b> ls -l
-rw-r--r-- 2 ttsiod users 27963392 2005-02-07 19:44 dolby-city.vob
</pre>

  <h3>3.1. Audio</h3>We 'll tackle the audio first: <b>mplayer</b>
  will decode the audio and convert it to plain stereo, feeding the
  output to a pipe:
<pre class="o">
<b>heaven:/var/tmp/video$</b> mkdir tmp
<b>heaven:/var/tmp/video$</b> mkfifo tmp/fifo
<b>heaven:/var/tmp/video$</b> tcscan -x pcm -i tmp/fifo &amp;
<b>heaven:/var/tmp/video$</b> mplayer \
    -ao pcm:nowaveheader:file=tmp/fifo \
    -vo null -vc dummy -benchmark dolby-city.vob \
    &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 
</pre>
This will output something like:
  <pre class="o">
.. audio frames=849.60, estimated clip length=33.98 seconds
.. (min/max) amplitude=(-0.252/0.274), suggested rescale=3.655
..
</pre><b>tcscan</b> provides the normalization factor we need for
our audio encoding process: usually, DVD audio has quite a dynamic
range, so it needs some boosting for our transcoding. Now that
tcscan has given us what we need, we'll encode the audio,
normalizing it in the process.

  <p>Since a volume rescale of 3.655 is 20*log10(3.655) db,
  we...</p>
  <pre class="o">
<b>heaven:/var/tmp/video$</b> echo '20*l(3.655)/l(10)' | bc -l
11.25774762587758519458
<b>heaven:/var/tmp/video$</b> oggenc -b 64 -o audio.ogg tmp/fifo &amp;
<b>heaven:/var/tmp/video$</b> mplayer -af volume=11.257747 -ao \
    pcm:file=tmp/fifo -vo null \
    -vc dummy -benchmark dolby-city.vob &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 
</pre>(you can also try "-q 0" instead of "-b 64" - Vorbis audio is quite good even in 64kbps, and we'll use just that in this test).

  <p>The audio part is now done (in a more or less optimal way, in
  terms of quality/bitrate).<br>
  Now the hard part: video.</p>

  <h3>3.2. Video</h3>

  <p>Video can be a pain in the neck. Before we even get to the
  encoding part, we need to clear it up.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>it can have black bands around it (almost certain);</li>

    <li>it can be interlaced (if it's from a camera, or from an
    NTSC DVD, quite probable);</li>

    <li>it can be too big for our bitrate, so it might need
    scaling.</li>
  </ul>You'll have to deal with this, setting up a filter chain in
  <b>mplayer</b>.

  <h4>3.2.1. Cropping</h4>Use cropdetect:
  <pre class="o">
<b>heaven:/var/tmp/video$</b> mplayer -vf cropdetect -nosound \
	dolby-city.vob
</pre>Navigate in the movie through the cursor/PgUp/PgDn keys to
make sure you've fed the filter all it needs to see from your
movie. In the end, abort <b>mplayer</b> and check the output for
the last of the "crop area" lines:
  <pre class="o">
crop area: X: 4..715  Y: 0..479  (-vf crop=704:464:8:8)
</pre>Crop settings are now known: <em>-vf crop=704:464:8:8</em>.
Test them:
  <pre class="o">
<b>heaven:/var/tmp/video$</b> mplayer -vf crop=704:464:8:8 \
	-nosound dolby-city.vob
</pre>

  <h4>3.2.2. Interlacing</h4>Interlacing is a different beast. Fire
  <b>mplayer</b> again, navigate to a part in the movie with lots
  of action, and hit the DOT key (<b>.</b>). This will pause the
  movie, and each time you hit it again, it will step exactly one
  frame. If the frames you see this way are clean, you don't need
  any deinterlacer ; if they appear to be "combed", you do. I could
  rant about the way to deinterlace for hours, but basically,
  you'll either be content with something as simple as
  <pre class="o">
<b>heaven:/var/tmp/video$</b> mplayer -vf pp=lb ...
</pre>or, if its an NTSC telecined one, with
  <pre class="o">
<b>heaven:/var/tmp/video$</b> mplayer -vf detc -ofps 23.976 ...
</pre>The latter one is the one you need for the dolby-city
trailer. It is a telecined beast, so it needs one heck of a filter
to get back to progressive.

  <h4>3.2.3. Scaling</h4>Finally, we 'll probably have to scale the
  video. How do we decide whether we want to, or not?

  <p>Mencoder's documentation suggests against this; the authors
  feel that frame scaling is too much tampering with the original
  video, and that this is bad. They are over-reacting; we are doing
  this to squeeze more data in less storage, and doing this at the
  extreme level we want to simply REQUIRES scaling (unless we are
  targeting video bitrates more than 1MBit/sec, but then, why
  bother with H264 and not stick to MPEG4?)</p>

  <p>To cut a very long story short, it was pointless to encode
  with MPEG4 - i.e. XVID, DIVX, or ffmpeg - to bitrates less than
  0.2 bits per pixel. With H264, this changes: we can go lower,
  e.g. 0.125 bits per pixel and still get acceptable quality.</p>

  <p>In <tt>dolby-city.vob</tt>, the original frame size is 720x480
  pixels, at a (progressive, after deinterlacing) frame rate of
  23.976 fps. This means that we would need at least</p>
  <pre class="o">
        720 x 480 x 23,976 x 0,125 = 1035763,2 bits per second
</pre>... if we were to avoid scaling. This bitrate is too high, we
can't even fit a 2 hour movie in a 700MB CD with this rate.<br>
  Since our movie has a 4:3 aspect ratio, we can simply scale to a
  smaller window, like
  <pre class="o">
        512 x 384 x 23,976 x 0,125 = 589234,176 bits per second
</pre>Notice that at this bitrate, we would be able
to fit 2.5 hours of movie time in one 700MB CD, since
  <pre class="o">
        Duration in seconds = 2,5*3600 = 9000 seconds
        Expected video size = 9000*589234,176/8 = 632 MBytes
        Expected audio size = 9000*64000/8  = 68 MBytes
</pre>...which would fit nicely in our 700MB target size (thanks to
Matroska's near zero cost multiplexing).<br>
  Notice also that we chose multiples of 16 for our frame sizes:
  this is not a whim, it's a requirement of almost all codecs.

  <h4>3.2.4. Using all filters</h4>So, to actually do this, we'll
  use three mencoder filters:

  <p><em>-vf crop=704:464:8:8,detc,scale=512:384</em></p>

  <p>The reason we are first cropping, then deinterlacing and
  finally scaling, should be obvious.<br>
  We can now complete the sequence with the H264 encoding
  parameters.</p>

  <p>I won't bother explaining why you should always use two
  passes, just read the relevant info (or trust me):</p>

  <p><em>Pass 1:</em></p>
  <pre class="o">
mencoder -nosound -ofps 23.976 \
	-vf crop=704:464:8:8,detc,scale=512:384 \
	dolby-city.vob \
	-o /dev/null -ovc x264 -x264encopts pass=1:bitrate=589
</pre><em>Pass 2:</em>
  <pre class="o">
mencoder -nosound -ofps 23.976 \
	-vf crop=704:464:8:8,detc,scale=512:384 \
	dolby-city.vob \
	-o video.avi -ovc x264 -x264encopts pass=2:bitrate=589
</pre>Check <tt>video.avi</tt>; it has no sound, but video quality
at this bitrate is simply beyond any comparison with MPEG4.

  <h2>4. Multiplexing</h2>Finally, we'll have to create the
  Matroska container for video and audio:
  <pre class="o">
mkvmerge --engage allow_avc_in_vfw_mode -o Perfect.mkv \
    video.avi audio.ogg
</pre>You might need to synchronize video and audio; check the
manpage for mkvmerge and learn how to use the -y switch. Or better yet,
use the script: it utilizes mencoder in a way that guarantees video
and audio will be in sync.
  <h2><a name="script"></a>5. Using the script</h2>You might
  consider the previous steps tiresome.<br>
  You are right; they are; and if you make one mistake along the
  line, you could end up spending CPU time for unacceptable
  results.

  <p>That's why I coded a very simple Perl script that glues
  together all that you've seen.<br>
  Download it <a href="vobs2mkv.pl">here</a> and use it like
  this: (<em>Update, August 2007: Thanks to Benjamin Pineau, if you are 
  using the latest versions of mplayer and mkvmerge, you can download a
  patch <A HREF="vobs2mkv.pl.diff">here</A> to support them)</em></p>
  <pre class="o">
<b>heaven:/var/tmp/video$</b> vobs2mkv.pl dolby-city.vob 3 Perfect.mkv
</pre>...which requests an encoding of the <tt>dolby-city.vob</tt>
movie, and a generation of file <tt>Perfect.mkv</tt> with a
size around 3 MBytes.<br>
  Follow the prompts it shows; they should be self explanatory.<br>
  If they are not, hey, check the code! I only use simple aspects
  of Perl, so you should be able to figure out what goes on
  (it works for me with all the files I tried).<p>It also attempts
  to rip any MPEG2 subtitles existing in the stream to VOBSUB files, 
  thus allowing a "perfect" rip; optimal video/audio/subtitle encoding.

  <p>This is the output (including the answers I gave) for
  'dolby-city.vob':</p>

<h2>6. Comparison with MPEG4</h2>
Since the script allows you to select the codec used, try encoding your own
videos around 0.125 bits per pixel with both MPEG4 and H.264. You won't be 
needing any screenshots for proof - your eyes will tell you that there's
only one obstacle for widespread H.264 adoption: encoding speed. Currently,
it is 2-5 times slower than MPEG4 encoding (depending on video type and 
CPU used). Let's hope x264 coders will improve the codec's speed over time.
