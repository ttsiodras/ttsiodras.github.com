            <p><em>(August 2022)</em></p>

<p>I first heard about TP4056 from various Youtubers - many years ago.</p>

<p>Modules equipped with that chip are dirt-cheap; yet allow for
easy and safe charging of the LiPos in our designs.</p>

<div style="clear:both; text-align:center; margin: 2em 0em 2em 0em">
<img src="TP4056.jpg" alt="TP4056 module">
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<em>TP4056 module</em>
</div>

<p>I proceeded to use these modules in my experiments. The setup
was easy: the LiPo gets connected to B+ and B-, and my load
was powered from OUT+ and OUT-.</p>

<p>Whenever I wanted to charge my LiPo, I'd plug my USB powerbank
to the TP4056 module input - and everything worked fine;
the LiPo charged at the max current I wanted <em>(selected via
a configuration resistor on the module board)</em>.</p>

<p>But sometimes, I wanted to charge the LiPo <em>and</em> feed my
load. At the same time.</p>

<p>This is apparently called <em>"Load Sharing"</em>, since the
power provided at the input is shared by <em>both</em> your load,
<em>and</em> your LiPo charging.</p>

<p>Following the example of the "expert" Youtubers, I did the same
thing in this scenario as well: I'd plug my powerbank in the
TP4056 module, and let it charge the LiPo, and <strong>simultaneously</strong>,
power my circuit from the OUT+ and OUT- points.</p>

<p>What I did not know, was that
<a href="https://blog.zakkemble.net/a-lithium-battery-charger-with-load-sharing/"
target="_blank">this was stupid - and dangerous</a>.</p>

<h1>Why?</h1>

<p>Zak's article, linked above, refers to a design that uses an MCP73831;
but what he says applies identically to the TP4056 as well; and in fact,
to any charging circuit.</p>

<div style="clear:both; text-align:center; margin: 2em 0em 2em 0em">
<img src="Load.sharing.0.png" alt="TP4056 schematic">
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<em>TP4056 schematic</em>
</div>

<p>Executive summary:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The charging chip tracks the battery's "full" condition by monitoring
the current "going in". If in addition to charging the LiPo, you also
drive your load... well, the chip is getting the wrong kind of feedback!</p></li>
<li><p>For example: let's say that normally, the TP4056 module will use the
two MOSFETs to disconnect your battery's "B-" when the charge current
falls below 10mA. If your load pulls, say, 15mA...  the chip
will never disconnect your battery! You will end up over-charging
your LiPo...</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You thought you were safe, and left your circuit in this
"combo-charging-load-running" configuration overnight, only to be woken 
up by a fire alarm...</p>

<h1>Solution - a P-channel MOSFET, setup in reverse</h1>

<p>Zak's solution is shown on the schematic on the left, below.
You'll notice that the MOSFET is actually connected in reverse to 
the usual P-channel setup <em>(on the right)</em> - input is to the Drain,
and output is from the Source:</p>

<div style="clear:both; text-align:center; margin: 2em 0em 2em 0em">
<img src="Load.sharing.1.png" alt="P-channel MOSFET to the rescue">
<img src="Load.sharing.P.png" alt="P-channel MOSFET to the rescue">
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<em>The top-green-line carries 5V from USB input to the Gate;<br>
the middle-green-line carries OUT+ from TP4056 to the Drain</em>
</div>

<p>So how does this work?</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>When there's no USB connection</strong>, the top-green-line is pulled down
with the 100K to ground. That means the voltage at the gate
drops to 0V. Now think of the internal MOSFET diode as dropping the
"usual" 0.7V from whatever it sees on the left <em>(i.e. on the Drain)</em>.
It follows then, that the voltage at the source drops to
V<em>(Drain)</em>-0.7V. Given the LiPo's voltage ranges between
3V and 4.2V, this puts the source voltage to something between 2.3V
and 3.5V; which is more than enough V<em>(GS)</em> to make the FET fully conduct.
We therefore get a "direct connection" between Drain and Source,
<strong>and our battery voltage goes through the FET and powers our load</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>When there's a USB connection</strong>, the top-green-line is at 5V.
That means the diode D1 is another (higher) source of voltage for our
MOSFET's Source; even after accounting for the usual 0.3V drop of a
Schottky, we drop from 5V to, say, 4.7V. The FET now sees a different
story for V<em>(GS)</em> - it sees the drop of the Schottky! It therefore doesn't 
conduct, <strong>and the battery gets completely cut off</strong>. Our 4.7V go
on to power our load, and at the same time, our completely isolated
LiPo gets charged by the TP4056. When that charge current goes below our
configured threshold, the battery's B- will be properly disconnected.
<strong>Simply put - no fire</strong> :&#x2011;)</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>Put to use</h1>

<p>I proceeded to modify one of my prototypes to implement this configuration
on a design I did a couple of years ago, that uses a GPS/Galileo receiver,
an RTC clock and a 16x2 LCD, driven and controlled by an Arduino.
It works quite well, getting accurate location/time information.</p>

<p>And yes, as seen below, I put it all on cardboard. Fire hazard on steroids :-)</p>

<p>All I needed to do, was to find a place for the resistor, Schottky and the FQP27P06.
Once I managed that, my multimeter showed that when I connected my
TP4056 to my USB powerbank, the MOSFET's source ended up at 4.6V...</p>

<div style="clear:both; text-align:center; margin: 2em 0em 2em 0em">
<picture>
  <source srcset="Load.sharing.2.webp" type="image/webp">
  <img src="Load.sharing.2.jpg" alt="P-channel MOSFET to the rescue">
</picture>
</div>

<p>...and when the powerbank was unplugged, the Source dropped to 3.65V
<em>(as expected; that was indeed my LiPo's charge level at the time)</em>:</p>

<div style="clear:both; text-align:center; margin: 2em 0em 2em 0em">
<picture>
  <source srcset="Load.sharing.3.webp" type="image/webp">
  <img src="Load.sharing.3.jpg" alt="P-channel MOSFET to the rescue">
</picture>
</div>

<p>In plain words: <strong>it worked</strong> :-)</p>

<p>In this prototype, the Source of the FET is then connected to a B6288-based
boost converter...</p>

<div style="clear:both; text-align:center; margin: 2em 0em 2em 0em">
<img src="boost.jpg" alt="Boost converter">
</div>

<p>...that takes the voltage up to 5V. That is then used
to feed the Arduino and all the rest - and it works regardless of whether
the boost converter sees V<em>(battery)</em> or 4.7V as an input.</p>

<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>This was a very simple modification to my charging circuitry;
and it allowed me to do proper load sharing. I <strong>strongly</strong> advise you
to do a similar modification, if <em>(like me)</em> you used your TP4056
to power your load and charge at the same time. <strong>Don't do that</strong>.
Also, checkout Zak's article: it has a lot more details and theory,
and many interesting discussions he has with people that doubt his design.</p>

<p>They shouldn't - it works perfectly.</p>
