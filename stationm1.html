            <p><em>(January 2021)</em></p>

<div class="tldr">
<b>TL; DR: Another year, another SBC!</b>
This time, it's a 4-core RK3328, with Gigabit Ethernet and USB3.
My fastest ARM-based computer yet!<p>

Let's install 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.armbian.com/">Armbian</a>
on it, and put it through performance tests.<p>
</div>

<h2>The hardware</h2>

<p>I received the Station M1 a few days ago - courtesy of
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.stationpc.com/">Firefly</a>.</p>

<div style="clear:both; text-align:center; margin: 0em 0em 0em 0em">
<img src="stationm1.jpg" alt="Credit-card sized, inside a metal enclosure"><p>
<em>Credit-card sized, inside a metal enclosure</em>
</div>

<p><font color="red"><b>Inside:</b></font></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>RK3328</strong> Quad-core A53 64bit CPU, at 1.5GHz</li>
<li>2GB or 4GB of <strong>DDR3 RAM</strong>. My board is the 2GB model, costing 65$ at the time I am writing this.</li>
<li>8/16/32/64/128GB <strong>EMMC</strong> for storage; my board came with 16GB. Note: you can also use Micro-SD cards.</li>
<li>802.11 b/g/n <strong>Wifi</strong> (2.4GHz) + bluetooth 4.2. Antenna is included inside the enclosure.</li>
<li>26 pin <strong>GPIO</strong> header - assuming you open the enclosure.</li>
</ul>

<p><font color="red"><b>Front:</b></font></p>

<ul>
<li>One <strong>USB3</strong> and one USB2 type-A ports.</li>
<li><strong>Infrared receiver</strong> - the SBC also comes with a remote control</li>
<li><strong>Micro-SD</strong> card slot</li>
<li><strong>Power button</strong>; a sorely missed feature in many other SBCs <em>(forcing
people like me to do <a href="remotepower.html" target="_blank">crazy</a> things)</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p><font color="red"><b>Back:</b></font></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>USB-C</strong> for power (5V)</li>
<li>1x <strong>HDMI2.0</strong>, supporting up to 4K@60Hz</li>
<li>RJ45 10/100/1000 (i.e. <strong>Gigabit Ethernet</strong>)</li>
<li>3.5mm <strong>audio jack</strong></li>
<li>All this in <strong>credit-card size!</strong> See picture with 2 Euro coin for size comparison.</li>
</ul>

<p>The SBC came with a power adapter, so I plugged it in, connected a Full-HD 
monitor to the HDMI port, and...</p>

<div style="clear:both; text-align:center; margin: 0em 0em 0em 0em">
<img src="stationm1-welcome.jpg" alt="Default setup screen"><p>
<em>Default setup screen</em>
</div>

<p>After 5 minutes of configuration setup, I ended up with a fully operational
Android 10 set-top box experience; with the provided remote control allowing
easy control of the pre-installed Kodi.</p>

<p>But if you want to see an Android review of this SBC, you are on the wrong 
site :-)<br>
I have far more fun <a href="android.html" target="_blank">hacking Android</a>
than I ever have using it.</p>

<p>So, to quote a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/EEVblog">famous electronics Youtuber</a>:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"Don't turn it on! <strong>Take it apart!</strong>"</em></p>

<p>...and I'll add: <em>"...and then install a fully open-source OS, compiled from scratch"</em>.</p>

<p>Keep reading :-)</p>

<h2>Disassembly</h2>

<p>There are 4 screws holding the enclosure firmly in place. After removing them,
the insides of the SBC are easily accessible:</p>

<div style="clear:both; text-align:center; margin: 0em 0em 0em 0em">
<img src="stationm1-disassembly.jpg" alt="Disassembled"><p>
<em>Disassembled.</em>
</div>

<p>As you can see, the Wi-Fi antenna is already pre-installed; the two chips 
giving my SBC 2GB of RAM are easily identifiable; and on the top, the
GPIO pins that make SBCs what they are - perfect toys for makers :-)</p>

<p>In case you are wondering, yes, that's a battery slot for an RTC.
I always use NTP, of course - but this is a nice perk for usage scenarios
where the SBC is not connected to the web.</p>

<p>In the case of the Station M1, the 3 pins shown in the picture below
form a 3.3V serial port, that speaks at 1500000 baud - in classic 8-N-1.
Any USB2TTL dongle that works with 3.3V levels will do nicely:</p>

</div>

<h2>The issue of SW - Armbian</h2>

<p>At a high level, there are basically two options with most ARM SBCs <em>(including this one)</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Either you trust the makers of the board with the custom
distributions they build (including Android ones).<br></li>
<li>Or you trust <a target="_blank" href="https://www.armbian.com/">Armbian</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am firmly in the second camp. I don't know where the makers of the Station M1
stand on the subject, but as a rule, SBC builders rarely - if ever - update
their custom distros. I can't abide by that.<p></p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://docs.armbian.com/Developer-Guide_Using-Vagrant/">
I therefore prefer building the entire, flashable Armbian distribution for my targets myself - from source</a>.
There is no better way to trust my SBCs, than knowing that I built their OS myself;
and that I can go as deep as I want and debug everything using the source code...
From the deepest dungeon at kernel level, all the way to the top-level bash scripts. </p>

<p>Then again, I do this sort of thing <a href="cv.pdf">for a living</a>. Your mileage may vary.</p>

<p>If you do decide to build from sources, the board is marked in the Armbian
<a href="https://github.com/armbian/build/blob/master/config/boards/station-m1.csc">repo</a>
as CSC - so you need to enable the CSC option during the build, and then
choose "Station M1". Other than that, everything just worked;
building went just as smoothly as any other flashable Armbian image I've compiled:</p>

<div class='codegenWrapper'>
<pre><tt><span class="normal">$ git clone https</span><span class="symbol">:</span><span class="normal">//github</span><span class="symbol">.</span><span class="normal">com/armbian/build</span><span class="symbol">/</span>
<span class="normal">$ cd build</span>
<span class="normal">$ sudo </span><span class="symbol">.</span><span class="normal">/compile</span><span class="symbol">.</span><span class="normal">sh</span>
</tt></pre>
</div>

<p>Since it takes some time to do this build, I performed it from an Ubuntu-Focal
Droplet that I created in my Digital Ocean account. At a cost of 3 cents per hour
and a total build time of approximately 3h, I paid 10 cents to have fully traceable
SW for my SBC.</p>

<p>Not bad :-)</p>

<p>Another option you have is to trust completely the Armbian developers - and simply
download the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.armbian.com/station-m1/">pre-built image</a>.</p>

<p>In either case, you then "flash" the image in any micro SD card.
In my case, I executed something like this:</p>

<pre><code># ls -l *img
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1816133632 Jan 20 20:06
    Armbian_21.02.0-trunk_Station-m1_bullseye_current_5.10.9.img

# dd if=Armbian_21.02.0-trunk_Station-m1_bullseye_current_5.10.9.img
    bs=1M oflag=sync iflag=fullblock status=progress of=/dev/sdc
</code></pre>

<p>When running this command, my Micro-SD card was inside a USB adapter plugged-in and visible under /dev/sdc.
Make sure you use the appropriate target here, <strong>otherwise you will wipe out your own machine's
data!</strong> The output of <code>dmesg</code> is your friend - look at it <em>(as well as the output
of <code>lsblk</code>)</em> to see the name of the device for your SD writer.</p>

<p>The <code>sync</code> output flag of <code>dd</code> caused a significant improvement in reliability with
my SD writer. You may or may not need this option - but if you don't use it,
make sure you actually invoke <code>sync</code> after <code>dd</code> is complete. And you will definitely
benefit from a big block size (<code>bs=1M</code>) and a nice and simple progress report
while the writing takes place (<code>status=progress</code>). </p>

<p>Most importantly: don't you dare remove the <code>fullblock</code> iflag. Trust me on
this - you need it.</p>

<h2>Booting Armbian</h2>

<p>After that, I plugged the Micro-SD card in the Station M1, and booted - in a 
normal, Armbian boot. I didn't use my USB-to-TTL adapter this time; the HDMI
cable offered a far easier way to interact with the boot process - and a
keyboard plugged in the USB2 port allowed me to easily work with the system.</p>

<p>I then connected the SBC directly to my router (over the Gigabit Ethernet
port), setup SSH, rebooted, and SSH-ed into the machine from my laptop.</p>

<p>Since I hate the speed and reliability aspects of Micro-SD cards, I then
proceeded to migrate into an external USB3 drive. I can probably migrate into
the EMMC, but I chose not to - I prefer to keep it in its pristine
("Android-y") state, for easy re-use when COVID allows me to visit people
again. A credit-card sized, portable set-top box is always nice :-)</p>

<p>To migrate to the external drive, I copied everything in the root fs into a
freshly formatted 5GB ext partition. The rest of the drive was formatted as
a LUKS-encrypted drive, which will take advantage of the crypto instructions
in this SBCs ARM cores.</p>

<p>I then modified two files in the SD-card filesystem to make the system boot
from the USB drive instead:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>/boot/armbianEnv.txt</code> needs to know where the root fs lives:</li>
</ul>

<div class='codegenWrapper'>
<pre><tt><span class="comment"># cat /boot/</span>
<span class="variable">verbosity</span><span class="symbol">=</span><span class="number">1</span>
<span class="variable">bootlogo</span><span class="symbol">=</span><span class="keyword">false</span>
<span class="variable">overlay_prefix</span><span class="symbol">=</span><span class="normal">rockchip</span>
<span class="variable">fdtfile</span><span class="symbol">=</span><span class="normal">rockchip/rk</span><span class="number">3328</span><span class="normal">-roc-pc</span><span class="symbol">.</span><span class="normal">dtb</span>

</tt></pre>
</div>

<p>The device UUID is easily obtainable via <code>blkid -c /dev/null</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>/etc/fstab</code> should also point to the proper root.
So the proper UUID needs to appear there:</li>
</ul>

<div class='codegenWrapper'>
<pre><tt><span class="comment"># cat /mnt/usb/etc/fstab</span>
<span class="variable">UUID</span><span class="symbol">=...</span><span class="normal"> </span><span class="symbol">/</span><span class="normal"> ext4 defaults</span><span class="symbol">...</span>
</tt></pre>
</div>

<p>That's it - the SBC now works from reliable, fast storage.</p>

<h2>How fast is it, with USB3 storage?</h2>

<p>Well, don't take my word for it - let's watch it in action:</p>

<p><center>
<a href="https://asciinema.org/a/386483" target="_blank"><img src="https://asciinema.org/a/386483.svg" /></a>
</center></p>

<p>What you can see in this <em>asciinema</em> video:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>This (110MB+ per second) is the same speed I have seen with this mechanical
external USB3 drive on any of my computers (including PCs). No slowdowns in
the Station M1.</p></li>
<li><p>Did you notice the temperature of 37C? This is my coolest SBC yet...
The metal enclosure and the thermal pad it uses to attach on the SoC perform
their work admirably.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Benchmarking CPU performance</h2>

<p>OK, but what if we stress the machine? Let's benchmark the device with my <a href="renderer.html">renderer</a>.</p>

<pre><code># apt install libsdl1.2-dev
...
# wget -q -O - https://github.com/ttsiodras/renderer/archive/v2.3c.tar.gz \
    | tar zxvf -
# cd renderer-2.3c
# ./configure
# make -j4
...
# make bench
</code></pre>

<p>My renderer uses all available cores, and stresses the memory and the FPU a lot <a href="#renderer">[1]</a>.
You can see results from all kinds of machines running it via the <a href="https://openbenchmarking.org/test/pts/ttsiod-renderer#metrics">Phoronix</a>
test suite.</p>

<p>For completeness, I include the results from all my ARM SBCs - so you can compare
for yourself.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Raspberry PI2</strong>: it reached 58C - and scored 17fps...</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Orange PI Zero</strong>: It scored 21 frames per second and its temperature rose above 80C.

</ul>

</tt></pre>
</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Station M1</strong>: Let's watch the newcomer live:</li>
</ul>

<p><center>
<a href="https://asciinema.org/a/386492" target="_blank"><img src="https://asciinema.org/a/386492.svg" /></a>
</center></p>

<p>The Station M1 scored 32.7 fps. It never exceeded 1.3GHz while doing so,
  which makes me think there's more potential here - the Armbian defaults
  can probably be bumped up. Not that I need more horsepower <em>(it offers
  more than what I need)</em> but it's still nice to know there's room to grow.</p>

<p>Also, very importantly - notice that even though we stressed the machine to
  an extreme - all cores fully utilised <em>(see second run with <code>top</code> in the
  first <code>tmux</code> pane for confirmation)</em> the temperature <strong>never went above 53C</strong>.</p>

<p>The enclosure barely felt warm during the test; nothing even remotely concerning.
  From a thermal perspective, amongst all my ARM SBCs, this is the one I trust the most.</p>

<h2>Network</h2>

<p>Is it truly a Gigabit device?</p>

<p>Well, the best way to confirm it, is to use another <a href="atomicpi.html">machine</a>
on the same Gigabit network, to send/receive data and benchmark via <code>iperf3</code>.</p>

<p>Again, let's see it done live:</p>

<p><center>
<a href="https://asciinema.org/a/386494" target="_blank"><img src="https://asciinema.org/a/386494.svg" /></a>
</center></p>

<p>That looks like Gigabit to me :-)</p>

<h2>Power consumption</h2>

<p>OK - so we know this is a more than fast enough SBC, with fast USB3
storage and Gigabit networking. But how does it fare in terms of
power consumption?</p>

<p>I revert the configuration to a Micro-SD based boot - to see how we score without an external USB3 drive attached:</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>I haven't yet exercised all features offered by this SBC. I am especially
looking forward to playing with its OpenGL capabilities :-) ...but my overall
impression so far is very <strong>positive</strong>. The combination of the metal
enclosure with a respectable performance at a low power consumption,
while giving Gigabit networking and USB3 speeds, makes it a very nice
machine indeed.</p>

<p>Aeons ago, I used SPARCstations - back when I was a student. And I was more
than happy with what I could do with their 40MHz brains.</p>

<p>To see now these ARM devices offer so much power, in credit-card-sized enclosures... 
It is really mind-blowing.</p>

<p>I've seen it all, methinks :-)</p>
