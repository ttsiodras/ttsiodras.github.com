<p>It was raining hard, a week ago.</p>

<p>And what could you possibly do on a rainy Saturday afternoon?</p>

<p>Well... I was inspired by <a target="_blank" href="https://hackaday.com/2017/01/27/forth-the-hackers-language/">a series of articles on Hackaday</a> to...</p>

<p><em>
<center>
...make a Forth interpreter/compiler from scratch...<BR>
...then put it inside a 1.5$ Blue Pill microcontroller...<BR>
...then repeatedly squash it until it fits inside an Arduino UNO...<BR>
...i.e. inside 2K of RAM!
</center>
</em></p>

<p>I haven't done anything even <em>remotely</em> close to this in decades.<br>
I <em>loved</em> building it :-)</p>

<p>The rainy afternoon turned into a week-long hackfest <em>(was looking
forward every day to the post-work FORTH-tinkering in the afternoon...)</em></p>

<p>The result: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ttsiodras/MiniForth/">a tiny, mini-Forth</a>. In portable C++ :-)<br>
It has...</p>

<ul>
<li>basic arithmetic</li>
<li>star-slash (double-word accurate muldiv)</li>
<li>literals</li>
<li>constants</li>
<li>variables</li>
<li>direct memory access</li>
<li>string printing</li>
<li>reseting</li>
<li>comments</li>
<li>nested DO/LOOP</li>
<li>comparisons</li>
<li>nested IF/ELSE/THEN</li>
<li>...and of course, functions (Forth words)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's a recording of it in action:</p>

<h1>ArduinoSTL and Valgrind / AddressSanitizer checks</h1>

<p>I meant it when I said "portable" - the <a href="https://github.com/ttsiodras/MiniForth/">source code</a>
compiles as-is for both native and Arduino builds.</p>

<p>Another part of my reasoning was that
in addition to targeting multiple platforms (e.g. BluePill and
Arduino) I wanted to be able to use Valgrind and AddressSanitizer
to detect - in the host! - any issues I have with my memory handling. 
And just as important, debugging with GDB in the native host is much easier/faster.</p>

<p>Since I had embedded targets in mind, I tried ArduinoSTL - but it was too
wasteful memory-wise. It also made the build process significantly slower.
I therefore built my own <a href="https://github.com/ttsiodras/MiniForth/tree/master/src/mini_stl.h">memory pool, as well as list, tuple and string-like C++ templates</a>. It was a nice challenge, re-inventing a tiny C++ STL...</p>

<p>And I understand STL a lot better now, after building small pieces of it myself :-)</p>

<h1>Simulation / Debugging</h1>

<p>I setup simulation via <a href="https://github.com/buserror/simavr.git">simavr</a>.
This tremendously improved my developing speed, since a simulator
spawns and runs much faster than the real board. Due to the code
being portable, debugging took place mostly in the host GDB;
and after Valgrind and AddressSanitizer gave their blessing, I usually
found out that the simulator (and the real board) worked fine as well.</p>

<h1>BluePill vs Arduino UNO</h1>

<p>Thanks to ArduinoSTL, I quickly reached the point of running inside the BluePill. The 1.5$ mini-monster has 10 times more SRAM than an Arduino UNO;
so in a couple of days, I had a <a href="https://github.com/ttsiodras/MiniForth/tree/BluePill-STM32F103C">working branch</a>.</p>

<div style="clear:both; text-align:center; margin: 0em 0em 0em 0em">
<img src="BluePill.jpg" alt="Before the Arduino UNO, I run my mini-FORTH inside the 1.5$ Blue Pill"><p>
<em>Before the Arduino UNO, I run my mini-FORTH inside the 1.5$ Blue Pill</em>
</div>

<p>But as said above, that wasn't nearly enough to make it work in my
Arduino UNO. That required far more work <em>(see below)</em>.</p>

<p>As for the BluePill, I should note that, as in all my other embedded targets,
I prefer a development workflow that is based on normal bootloaders
<em>(not on programmers)</em>.  I therefore burned the
<a href="https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/STM32duino-bootloader">stm32duino</a>
bootloader on the BluePill, which allowed me to easily program it
in subsequent iterations via the USB connection (and a simple <code>make upload</code>).</p>

<p>The same USB connection would then function as a serial port immediately
afterwards - allowing me to interact with the newly uploaded Forth in the
BluePill.</p>

<p>The screenshot below is from a <code>tmux</code>: on the left, the output from <code>make upload</code>;
and on the right, I used <code>picocom</code> to interact with my mini-Forth
over the serial port:</p>

<h1>Memory - the final frontier</h1>

<p>That covered the first two days.</p>

<p>But when I tried compiling for the Arduino UNO, I realised that the ArduinoSTL
was not enough. I run out of memory...</p>

<p>So I built my own <a href="https://github.com/ttsiodras/MiniForth/tree/master/src/mini_stl.h">mini-STL</a>,
and tightly controlled <em>all</em> memory utilisation.</p>

<p>I also used macro-magic to move all strings to Flash at compile-time
(see <code>dprintf</code> in the code)... And saved memory everywhere I could,
re-using error messages across various operations - and storing the
entire array of native operations in Flash.</p>

<p>Nothing flexes your coding muscles as much as optimising; whether it is
for speed or for space. See the implementation of ".S" for example,
where the (obvious) stack reversal code is also the most wasteful...
Changing it to a slower but memory-preserving algorithm allowed me
to use ".S" even when almost all my memory is full.</p>

<h1>C++ vs C</h1>

<p>I know that many developers hate C++. I even wrote a
<a href="https://www.thanassis.space/cpp.html">blog post</a> about it.</p>

<p>And I understand why - they see code like this...</p>

<pre><code>#include "mini_stl.h"

template&lt;class T&gt;
typename forward_list&lt;T&gt;::box *forward_list&lt;T&gt;::_freeList = NULL;
</code></pre>

<p>...and they start screaming - "what the hell is that", "incomprehensible
madness", etc.</p>

<p>But there are very important benefits in using C++ - and templates 
in particular. You write less code, with no additional run-time or
memory overhead compared to C, and with a lot more compile-time checks
that watch your back (for things that would otherwise blow up in your face).</p>

<p>See my Optional<T> for example, that emulates (badly) the optional
type of Rust/OCaml/F#/Scala/Kotlin etc. It <strong>forces</strong> you to check
your returned error codes:</p>

<pre><code>Optional&lt;int&gt; Forth::needs_a_number(const __FlashStringHelper *msg)
{
    if (_stack.empty())
        return error(emptyMsgFlash, msg);
    auto topVal = *_stack.begin();
    if (topVal._kind == StackNode::LIT)
        return topVal._u.intVal;
    else
        return FAILURE;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can't "forget" to check the potential for a failure coded inside 
your returned value - because your code has to "unwrap" it. I could have
done this better, but I chose to implement it via simple tuples
(this was a one-weeks-afternoons hack, after all :-)</p>

<p>As for the template "magic" incantation above - it <em>is</em> true magic: My
<code>forward_list</code> template is using free-lists to store the <code>pop_front</code>-ed
elements and reuse them in subsequent allocations. I wanted these free-lists to
be global (i.e. static members) because lists of the same type must re-use a
single, commonly-shared free-list. The magic spell tells the compiler I want to
instantiate these globals <em>once</em>, for each type T that I use in any 
lists in my code.</p>

<h1>My Forth test scenario - including a FizzBuzz!</h1>

<h1>Automation</h1>

<p>I am a strong believer in automation. The final form of my <code>Makefile</code>
therefore has many rules - e.g. <code>make arduino-sim</code> - that automate
various parts of the workflow.</p>

<p>Here's what they do:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>arduino</strong>: Compiles the code for Arduino UNO - builds <code>src/tmp/myforth.ino.{elf,hex}</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>arduino-sim</strong>: After building, launches the compiled mini-Forth in <code>simduino</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>upload</strong>: After building, uploads to an Arduino attached to the port
      configured inside <code>config.mk</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>terminal</strong>: After uploading, launches a <code>picocom</code> terminal with
        all appropriate settings to interact with my Forth.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>x86</strong>: Builds for x86. Actually, should easily build for any native target (ARM, etc).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>test-address-sanitizer</strong>: Uses the x86 binary to test the code, executing
all steps of the scenario shown above. The binary is built with the
address sanitizer enabled (to detect memory issues).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>test-valgrind</strong>: Same, but with Valgrind.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>test-simulator</strong>: Spawns <code>simavr</code> and sends the entire test scenario shown
              above to it - while showing the responses received from it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>test-arduino</strong>: Sends the entire test scenario shown above to an
            Arduino Uno connected to the port specified in <code>config.mk</code>
            and shows the responses received over that serial port.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Another example of automation - the complete test scenario shown in the 
previous section, is not just an example in the documentation; it is 
extracted automatically from this text and fed into the Valgrind and
AddressSanitizer tests... and also into the Python testing script that
sends the data to the board in real-time.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>, folks.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>I thoroughly enjoyed building this. I know full well that Forths are not
supposed to be built in C++; they are supposed to be built in assembly,
and also, utilise the Flash to store the user-compiled code at run-time.</p>

<p>But that wasn't the point of this - the point was to have fun and learn Forth.<BR>
What better way to learn a language... than to actually implement it! :-)</p>

<p>And... as a child of the 80s...  I now know first-hand what
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_Ace">Jupiter Ace</a> was about :-)</p>

<p>Fork the code, and enjoy tinkering with it!<BR></p>
